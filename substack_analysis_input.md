Best practices for LLM development LLMs are transforming software development, but integrating them into real projects can be tricky when models don&#8217;t understand your codebase, pipelines, or conventions. Join Dagster on January 27th for a practical look at data engineering best practices, common pitfalls, and live demos of LLM developments. Reserve your spot now. Foundation Capital: AI&#8217;s trillion-dollar opportunity: Context graphs Agents are cross-system and action-oriented. The UX of work is separating from the underlying data plane. Agents become the interface, but something still has to be canonical underneath. This will be a core construct of the next evolution of data engineering. A scalable data infrastructure that gives a unified view of the system of records and the analytical data, past decision traces, and a system of record that accepts high concurrent modifications. The promise of agents holds, but I don&#8217;t think our underlying infrastructure is ready for it. https://foundationcapital.com/context-graphs-ais-trillion-dollar-opportunity/ ThoughtWorks: How to build the organizational muscle needed to scale AI beyond PoCs Thoughtworks argues that AI initiatives fail to scale beyond pilots because organizations hit compliance hurdles, data silos, and lack stakeholder engagement&#8212;problems that require building "organizational muscle" rather than buying technology solutions. The article recommends a "thin slice" approach that addresses five building blocks simultaneously for a single use case: starting with clear business outcomes instead of technology, building tech platforms incrementally based on concrete needs, creating repeatable MLOps paths to production through cross-functional product teams, and investing in AI literacy and human-collaborative tool design to drive sustained adoption. https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/how-to-build-organizational-muscle-needed-to-scale-AI Sharon Campbell-Crow: Multi-Agent Systems: The Ar...

## Post 2: A Critique of Iceberg REST Catalog: A Classic Case of Why Semantic Spec Fails

**Content Preview:**
&#8220;Latency is not just a performance characteristic; it is a fundamental part of correctness.&#8221; &#8212; Designing Data-Intensive Applications In Designing Data-Intensive Applications , Martin Kleppmann makes a subtle but critical point: the CAP theorem omits latency, yet in real systems, latency often determines whether a system is usable at all. A system that is correct but slow is, in practice, incorrect. This observation is directly applicable to the Apache Iceberg REST Catalog specification . While the specification achieves semantic clarity, it fails to define the operational realities that enable distributed systems to remain predictable at scale. The result is a standard that is formally correct, yet operationally fragile. Semantic Interoperability Without Predictability Over the past two years, the Iceberg REST Catalog specification has emerged as the de facto standard for metadata access in the Iceberg ecosystem. We have seen the outburst of the catalog war around the REST spec. It promises a universal interface that allows engines such as Trino, Spark, Flink, and StarRocks to interact with Iceberg tables via a common REST abstraction, independent of the underlying catalog implementation. At the semantic level, this promise largely holds. The specification rigorously defines metadata structures: tables, schemas, snapshots, and namespace operations. A LoadTable or CreateNamespace request looks identical across implementations. This semantic interoperability has been critical to Iceberg&#8217;s rapid ecosystem adoption. However, semantic interoperability alone is insufficient. The specification defines what metadata operations mean, but it avoids specifying how they must behave in real-world conditions, such as concurrency, latency sensitivity, and cross-catalog synchronization. This gap&#8212;between semantic interoperability and operational interoperability&#8212;is where systems begin to fail in production. The Core Problem: No Operational SLA, No...

Editor&#8217;s Note: The Edition of Predictions!! Well, Mostly It is always exciting to read the predictions and look back on 2025. I put a lot of effort into collecting some of these predictions and bundling them in this edition. At DEW, we also reached a few existing milestones. We just published our 250th edition and reached 50,000 Substack followers. It is remarkable growth, considering how lazy I am on LinkedIn and how little I promote DEW. I&#8217;m looking to improve on it, and over the holidays, I tried a bit of Agent building on top of DEW, which I&#8217;m hoping to launch soon. I wish all the DEWers a prosperous 2025 and thank you for your continued support. Ananth Packkildurai: DEW - The Year in Review 2025 Why not start with our own year-in-review and a bit of predictions? Agent Engineering is undoubtedly becoming a discipline of its own in engineering, similar to the rise of data scientists. Both, funny enough, run into data inconsistency issues, and everyone does data engineering eventually. ( Hello Context Engineering ) I wrote a bit about how the catalog becomes the new database as the adoption of Apache Iceberg and Knowledge Engineering increases. I&#8217;ve a lot of concern about the Iceberg Rest Catalog, which I will write about as a separate blog this week.

If 2023 was the year of &#8220;Shock&#8221; and 2024 was the year of &#8220;Hype,&#8221; 2025 will be remembered as the year of Engineering . For the past decade, our industry has been obsessed with the mechanics of movement. We argued about &#8220;ETL vs. ELT.&#8221; We fought &#8220;Format Wars&#8221; over table specifications. We optimized commit protocols and debated the merits of various orchestrators. We were, fundamentally, digital plumbers ensuring the water reached the tap. But in 2025, the mandate changed. The business no longer wants &#8220;data&#8221;; it demands &#8220;intelligence.&#8221; It demands systems that reason, agents that act, and infrastructure that guarantees truth in a non-deterministic world. The &#8220;Big Data&#8221; era of managing volume formally ended, replaced by the &#8220;Context Era&#8221; of managing meaning. We are no longer just Data Engineers. We are the architects of the cognitive layer. Here are the seven patterns that defined Data &amp; AI Engineering in 2025. 1. Agent Engineering: The Inevitable Evolution of the Pipeline The most significant shift of 2025 was the industry&#8217;s realization that &#8220;Agents&#8221; are not just fancy chatbots&#8212;they are the new compute engine. In 2024, we treated LLMs as text generators. In 2025, we started treating them as reasoning engines that execute logic we previously wrote in Python or SQL. This birthed a new discipline: Agent Engineering . We moved beyond the chaotic &#8220;vibes-based&#8221; coding of early experiments into structured, rigorous engineering. We stopped asking &#8220;Can AI write code?&#8221; and started asking &#8220;How do we architect a system where AI reliably executes complex workflows?&#8221; The Rise of Context Engineering The bottleneck for intelligent systems shifted from model capacity to context management . We realized that an agent is only as smart as the context you feed it. Anthropic defined the year with their masterclass on Effective Context ...

I had this very conversation recently. A friend of mine claimed that it is now easy to build a CRM and that everyone will build their own, thereby making all SaaS companies obsolete in the near future. It&#8217;s cheaper to manufacture software now, but SaaS companies don&#8217;t win on manufacturing. They win on distribution, trust, and operational burden.

With the increased adoption of the Lakehouses, we removed the last constraint on data accumulation. We didn&#8217;t realize we were removing the last constraint on data obesity . The numbers are staggering. Enterprises now store 2.5 times more data than they did in 2019, yet the velocity of decisions derived from that data hasn&#8217;t just slowed&#8212;it has flatlined. According to IDC, global data storage capacity is estimated to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025, with 80% of that data unstructured. Furthermore, IDC predicts that 90% of unstructured data will remain unanalyzed . This is data obesity: the condition where an organization accumulates data faster than it can derive value from it. It&#8217;s not a storage problem. It&#8217;s a metabolic one. When Storage Became Infinite, Attention Became Finite The obesity crisis began with the Lakehouse. Built on the triumvirate of S3, ADLS, and GCS, and crowned with Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Hudi, the Lakehouse solved data engineering&#8217;s oldest constraint: where to put the data. Object storage made retention elastic and nearly free. The cost of a gigabyte has fallen by 80% over the past decade, while enterprise data volume has grown by 250%. However, the Lakehouse didn&#8217;t just lower costs&#8212;it removed the psychological barrier to data collection. When a terabyte costs less than a pizza, no one asks hard questions before ingesting. When schema evolution is automatic, there&#8217;s no migration friction to discourage table sprawl. When time travel promises infinite rollback, deletion feels like the destruction of potential value. The result is a modern manifestation of Jevons&#8217; Paradox : as storage became more efficient, our appetite for data expanded even more rapidly. We&#8217;ve built systems that can collect anything, but can&#8217;t measure whether that collection matters. The Hidden Cost of Free Storage Here&#8217;s what Lakehouse architecture diagrams don&#8217;t show: storage accounts for only 8% ...

No tickets. No waiting. Set up your free account in minutes. Lak Lakshmanan: What it means to get your data ready for AI One of the most challenging questions in every data org is the efficient and successful adoption of AI agents to enhance productivity and efficiency. The author outlines five resulting changes: moving from heavy normalization to context-rich data, prioritizing curated exemplars for in-context learning, building agent-ready infrastructure for perception and tool use, treating agent-generated artifacts as first-class data, and connecting observability to continuous model retraining. These shifts reposition data engineering toward enabling flexible, context-aware AI systems, changing the role from building rigid pipelines to designing environments where agents autonomously operate and improve. https://ai.gopubby.com/what-it-means-to-get-your-data-ready-for-ai-518861a8f025 IBM: The 2025 CDO Study - The AI multiplier effect Only 26% of CDOs are confident their organization can use unstructured data in a way that delivers business value.

## Post 14: Thinking Like a Data Engineer

**Publication:** Data Engineering Weekly

I thought becoming a data engineer meant mastering tools. Instead, it meant learning how to see. I thought the hardest part would be learning the tools &#8212; Hadoop, Spark, SQL optimization, and distributed processing. Over time, I realized the real challenge wasn&#8217;t technical. It was learning how to think . Learning to think like a data engineer &#8212; to see patterns in chaos, to connect systems to human behavior, to balance simplicity and scale &#8212; is a slow process of unlearning, observing, and reimagining. I didn&#8217;t get there through courses or certifications. I got there through people. Four mentors, in four different moments of my life, unknowingly gave me lessons that shaped how I approach engineering, leadership, and even life. Each taught me something not about data, but about thinking systems . What follows isn&#8217;t a tutorial. It&#8217;s a map of how four people &#8212; and their lessons &#8212; rewired how I think. #1. &#8220;Chasing Knowledge.&#8221; One of my friends recently asked why you are constantly reading and writing. It all started with an internship. A family friend of mine helped me find an internship. He was the person who taught me Java &#8212; patiently explaining not just syntax, but how to think through logic, abstraction, and design. When I called him after getting my first full-time job, I expected congratulations or career advice. Instead, he said something that I only understood years later: &#8220;Don&#8217;t chase money. Chase knowledge. Money will follow.&#8221; The advice struck a chord with me forever. In technology, everything changes &#8212; languages, frameworks, stacks, even paradigms. But curiosity compounds. The more you learn, the faster you learn. The more you focus on mastering fundamentals, the easier it becomes to adapt when the next wave arrives. That advice became a quiet compass throughout my career. Every time I faced a decision &#8212; whether to take a higher-paying role or a role that stret...

## Post 16: Revisiting Medallion Architecture: Data Vault in Silver, Dimensional Modeling in Gold

**Publication:** Data Engineering Weekly

**Published:** 2025-10-17T04:00:51+00:00

**Content Preview:**
For more than two decades, the data warehousing community has grappled with a fundamental and largely misplaced debate: whether Data Vault or dimensional modeling produces a &#8220;better&#8221; data warehouse . Each camp has spent years evangelizing its methodology as superior, assuming that a singular modeling paradigm could&#8212;or should&#8212;address every requirement in a modern analytics platform. What is the consequence of this binary thinking? Organizations have invested heavily in architectures that, while optimized for one objective, fail catastrophically in others. Rigid star schemas provide blazing-fast analytics but crack under schema changes. Data Vaults offer unmatched schema flexibility and auditability but impose significant query complexity and performance limitations. The truth is, neither model is universally superior because neither was designed to be. Instead, they were built for different purposes&#8212;and those purposes align neatly with different stages of the data lifecycle. Modern data platforms have evolved beyond monolithic warehouse architectures. The rise of the medallion architecture&#8212;Bronze, Silver, Gold&#8212;presents an opportunity to align data modeling strategies with the distinct goals of each layer. A best-practice implementation of this architecture often looks like this: raw data lands in Bronze, is integrated and historized into a Data Vault model in the Silver layer, and is then transformed into performance-optimized dimensional models in the Gold layer for consumption. In this model: Data Vault shines in the Silver layer , where schema evolution, historical traceability, and source system integration dominate. Dimensional modeling flourishes in the Gold layer , where performance, usability, and business semantics reign supreme. This article explores the architectural insight that has quietly become an industry best practice: use Data Vault in Silver and dimensional modeling in Gold. This pattern didn&#8217;t emerge...

## Post 18: Engineering Growth: The Data Layers Powering Modern GTM

**Publication:** Data Engineering Weekly

**Published:** 2025-10-07T19:14:42+00:00

**Content Preview:**
Growth no longer rewards the widest net. Modern Go-To-Market(GTM) teams win with precision, not volume. They build revenue on infrastructure&#8212;pipelines, warehouses, and customer data platforms that turn signals into action. The shift is fundamental. Marketing teams once measured impressions and clicks. Sales teams worked from cold lists. Customer success reacted to churn. Today, these functions operate as a unified data ecosystem, synchronizing zero-, first-, second-, third-, and fourth-party data into coordinated market motion. Data engineers architect this system. We design the pipelines that define GTM accuracy, latency, and trust. When we build it well, the marketing, sales, and customer success move in harmony. When we don&#8217;t, the entire revenue engine stutters. But not all data is created equal. The modern GTM stack draws from five distinct data sources, each with unique engineering challenges, governance requirements, and strategic value: Zero-party data: What customers intentionally share through preferences and explicit consent First-party data: What you observe through behavioral tracking and product interactions Second-party data: What partners share through privacy-preserving collaboration Third-party data: What vendors sell through aggregated external sources Fourth-party data: What emerges from multi-company consortium networks Each data type requires different infrastructure, carries different levels of trust, and demands different engineering disciplines. Understanding these distinctions isn&#8217;t academic&#8212;it&#8217;s foundational to building GTM systems that scale, comply with regulations, and deliver measurable business impact. This article examines the GTM stack through the lens of data provenance, exploring not only what data powers modern go-to-market strategies but also how to engineer systems that integrate these five data sources responsibly and effectively.

In this episode of the Data Engineering Central Podcast, I interview a Data OG, someone who&#8217;s been around the data space forever, and we talked about all things data, past, present, and future. I&#8217;m joined by Thomas Horton a longtime friend and one of the most well-rounded data professionals I know. Over the course of his career, Tom has worn just about every hat in data: developer, DBA, analyst, and everything in between. He&#8217;s lived through the era of on-prem databases, the rise of analytics, and the constant reinvention that defines modern data engineering today. We talk about what&#8217;s changed, what hasn&#8217;t, and why many of the &#8220;new&#8221; problems in data feel oddly familiar. We also dig into lessons learned the hard way, lessons that are just as relevant for early-career data engineers as they are for seasoned practitioners navigating today&#8217;s ever-expanding stacks. Subscribe now On a personal note, a huge portion of what I know about relational databases and analytics can be traced back to Tom. This conversation is part reflection, part history lesson, and part reality check on where the data industry is headed next.

There is truth in what he says, &#8220; All roads lead to Excel . &#8221; It does depend on the size and nature of the business in which a data person finds themselves. Still, at the end of the day, if you have any resemblance to different business groups to deal with, like Accounting, Marketing, Product, Ops, etc, then Excel drives and contains ALOT of business context. Truth be told, business users can use Excel, and it works. It is no surprise at all that Databricks released support for Excel as both a data&nbsp; source &nbsp;and sink .

I am sort of an addict for a good Lake House; it&#8217;s just an incredible architecture that is a joy to build and use daily. No more SQL Server or Oracle, you know what I&#8217;m saying if you were born in the right decade. Truth be told, at this point in the Modern Data Stack lifecycle, you pretty much have two major Lake House storage layers that dominate the landscape: Iceberg and Delta. I was surprised when DuckDB/MotherDuck threw their hat in the ring with DuckLake. Didn&#8217;t see that coming at the time. Like anything done by DuckDB, it&#8217;s always top-notch and for a good reason. They have a knack for doing things right. Ever since I wrote that first article, I&#8217;ve been meaning to return to DuckLake and try it out in a more open-source setting again. What I mean by that is can I use maybe a RDS Postgres instance and back DuckLake on AWS S3. I mean, if someone is actually looking to use DuckLake in the open as a viable alternative to Iceberg and Delta Lake, then that is the game. Checkout today&#8217;s sponsor Carolina Cloud One-click notebooks, genomics tools, and Ubuntu VMs at 1/3 the cost of AWS with no egress fees If you enjoy Data Engineering Central, please check out our sponsor's website above .

That&#8217;s not my focus today, as usual, I want to simply throw a problem at the DuckLake architecture, turn over a few rocks, and see what crawls out.

About three years ago, over on my other long-running blog, I wrote about Apache Arrow , that silent but mighty tool that is swallowing up the Data Landscape one bite at a time. I figured it&#8217;s due time I again tip my hat to that great Oz hidden behind the digital curtain. It&#8217;s hard to even know where to start with Arrow ; it&#8217;s so ubiquitous and has infiltrated just about every Data Engineering framework built in the last 5 years+. I very much doubt I can do Arrow any real justice, but I will give it a try. Come along for the ride, my friend. My goals are simple, I hope you come away with &#8230; a new respect for Apache Arrow knowledge of where all Arrow is used a curiosity to use Apache Arrow yourself This is where the road lies before us, with lots of twists and turns. I don&#8217;t know where exactly we are going or how we will get there, but we can trust it will all work itself out in the end. Let&#8217;s get to it shall we? Read more...

I was recently in conversation with some people about AI, its use cases, the good and the bad, where it fits, and where it doesn&#8217;t. It was brought up in the context of reading random PDFs and generating JSON files from their contents. This got me thinking. Can you, should you, and what will happen, if we use LLMs not just to puke out the next code snippet &#8230; but what if we use an LLM mixed with a little Agentic AI, to actually to BE the data pipeline???? It is a strange thought. I&#8217;m sure people are doing it. Maybe. It&#8217;s one thing for an LLM to spit out code for a Data Pipeline; it's another for an LLM to be the data pipeline, or at least part of it. I want to try it. What say you? Thanks for reading Data Engineering Central! This post is public so feel free to share it. Share Inserting LLMs into Data Pipelines ( all code on GitHub for this ) I&#8217;ve built my fair share of RAGs, vector stores, Chat this Chat that bots &#8230; whatever. I also use Cursor on a semi-regular basis, maybe a few times a week, either as something to bounce ideas off of or to generate some mindless code. One thing I&#8217;ve never done is try to use an LLM in the loop or stage of a data pipeline. This will be new for me, as it is for you, and I am going to list out loud some of the questions I have at large about doing this sort of work. At this point, I have no idea how it will work out. Some questions I&#8217;m asking myself. I think it&#8217;s one thing for me to play around and force an LLM to do a thing by using coercion, glue, and string to make something happen, vs. an actual workflow that could be used in production. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s on my mind. A small local LLM or a remote API-based one? Can we force an LLM model to do what we need, or do we need an Agent? To actually write/place (JSON) files on disk Are orchestration tools like Airflow starting to provide, say, OpenAI operators? LLM output is non-deterministic; it can hallucinate at any time. How...

In a continuation of a topic I&#8217;ve written about off and on over the last few months ( Apache Iceberg and Catalog options ), I&#8217;m taking another stab at finding &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;approachable&#8221; Catalog options that support Apache Iceberg. By &#8220; good &#8221; and &#8220; approachable ,&#8221; I mean something that can be easily installed and run in a semi-production-ready state by an A verage Engineer in a reasonable amount of time with a small amount of troubleshooting. The truth is I am a glass-half-empty kind of guy regarding most technology. Nothing angers me more when a talking head declares the next most remarkable thing is released and shows how well it worked on their laptop. I prefer to try tools out in an environment where the hidden rocks pop out of the water and sink your happy boat. Amazingly, all a person is required to do is use a Linux server and some AWS credentials to do just that. Thanks for reading Data Engineering Central! This post is public so feel free to share it.

I&#8217;m getting to the point where I&#8217;m a little burnt out on hearing about AI this and AI that. Work, LinkedIn, YouTube, Substack &#8230; it&#8217;s a never-ending glut of AI-generated content talking about AI. I get the sense that the closest most developers get to AI is asking Cusor to puke out the next code chunk. Classic. I&#8217;ve never been one to make a mountain out of a mole hill. I find myself adrift in the middle ground of the AI purgatory we find ourselves in as writers of code. There seem to be two deeply entrenched cabals of software engineers. AI is for the weak; humans forever. Vibe code your way to glory. The truth is that the middle is most likely slanted towards the AI is the future group. You cannot turn back the clock once you&#8217;ve opened Pandora&#8217;s box. Will there always be a bright future for intelligent and industrious writers of code and systems? Absolutely. Is AI here to stay and an extreme force multiplier in the creation and execution of software of all kinds? Absolutely. Old dogs die hard, and the old guard is having a hard time swallowing the new reality. Let&#8217;s bring it all back down to earth. I am no AI expert, but I&#8217;ve probably done more than most, including fine-tuning my own LLM. I don&#8217;t get overly excited about building AI, insofar as it&#8217;s actually helpful and interesting problems to solve. I would guess that there is a fair number of Data Engineers and others who may be overwhelmed by the fast pace of development in AI and LLMs, and feel a little left behind and lost. I assure you, there is hope. Just remember, all those liars on LinkedIn and Reddit trying to be AI smart, they breathe the same air and drink the same water you and I do. I&#8217;m going to prove that to you by showing how easy it is for you to build an AI SQL Agent. Forget all the too-bright suckers, confusing acronyms; you, my friend, are capable of building &#8220;Agentic AI.&#8221; Don&#8217;t listen to the haters. Let&#82...

## Post 33: Data Mesh Theology. Dead or Alive?

Meh. That's how I feel about the languishing and short-lived ideology called &#8220; Data Mesh. &#8221; The Modern Data Stack has seen its fair share of prophets seeking the loving embrace of the community, a fickle thing, only to fall out of favor all too soon. Data Mesh appears to be one of those ideas. The thing is, I keep my trained ear close to the ground, listening to the comings and goings of various and sundry ideas. Watching what becomes popular, what dies on the vine. But I won&#8217;t be the judge of that in the end. Never say never. Let&#8217;s just lay it all out. Try to understand what a Data Mesh architecture is How long has it been around Pros and cons Is there any hope left for mainstream adoption? This is just as much for me as for you. I have my preconceived notions, of course, but we will try to give Data Mesh a fair shake and see where it's come from and where it might be going. You know one thing is true &#8230; those cloud compute bills are getting out of hand. Check out https://carolinacloud.io/ for High-Performance CPUs, GPUs, Notebooks,&nbsp; and &nbsp;Bare-Metal Servers. If you want to save serious money on compute, head over to Carolina Cloud. What is Data Mesh? (In Plain English) Data Mesh is an architectural approach that aims to address the problems of large, centralized data teams by&nbsp; decentralizing &nbsp;data ownership. Instead of one monolithic team owning all datasets, each domain (fraud, marketing, product, etc.) owns its data as a product . This can best be explained visually, contrasted with the most common approach of gathering all data into a single spot to be shared from there. Let me give you a few bullet points to further drive home what a Data Mesh Architecture is. decentralized data architecture, domain-oriented self-serve design &#8220;Responsibility for analytical data is shifted from the central data team to the domain teams.&#8221; This is in direct opposition to the classic approach of a single Data Platform tea...

Oh, that age-old topic of Data Quality, often discussed but never implemented. Poor little blighter. Who knows what it&#8217;s like to be the old, beat-up rock that always gets kicked, gets no love or attention, just told about everything you do wrong ( try writing a Substack like me, you&#8217;ll find out quick enough ). That is Data Quality, isn't it? The age-old question. And the age-old answer. Nothing could be truer and to the point. Thanks to Delta for sponsoring this newsletter! I personally use Delta Lake on a daily basis, and I believe this technology represents the future of Data Engineering. Content like this would not be possible without their support. Check out their website below. Data Quality isn&#8217;t cool enough. I&#8217;ve written about Data Quality a few times over the years; it&#8217;s simply not a popular or sexy topic. Always mediocre reaction to mediocre tools that don&#8217;t work well. Truth be told, Data Quality is something CTOs and Data Leaders love to talk about, but when you ask them to either pony up some money for a tool, or pay some engineers for work on this topic for a quarter or two, you get mumbling, muttering, and a general waving of hands. Then it&#8217;s back to business as normal. It&#8217;s always sight out of mind, the old nagging suspicion in the back of the head. Random data problems that pop up and get fixed.

Hello, this is Daniel! Today, we have another Guest Post from Alejandro Aboy . You can check out his Substack The Pipe and the Line. Alejandro Aboy is a data engineer at Workpath, building scalable pipelines with Airflow, dbt, and the modern data stack. Through The Pipe &amp; The Line , he writes hands-on tutorials on topics like building dbt-style orchestrators with Python and DuckDB, and implementing RAG systems for data engineers Let&#8217;s get started! Most orchestration tutorials start with Airflow DAGs processing static CSV files. You see the fancy UI, the complex graphs, the task dependencies, and think, &#8220;this is what real data engineering looks like.&#8221; When I say Airflow I also mean Mage, Kestra, Dagster, Prefect or whatever many other options of orchestrator we have out there in the market right now. I remember when I was starting out and first saw Airflow demos. Beautiful graphs, complex DAGs, Redis queues, Celery workers. Data enthusiasts might be getting the wrong idea, bootcamps or courses out there place Airflow as the only option to make your workflows come to life. The truth? There are levels to this. Your orchestration approach should match your project maturity, not your aspirations. And this principle also gets dragged everywhere else, even to data teams making decisions based on FOMO and now on their own context. The Modern Data Stack narrative usually pushes dbt, Airflow, Snowflake, and Fivetran as the default starting point. Most teams don&#8217;t need the complete solution on day one, or they don&#8217;t even need it at all. There&#8217;s something in the middle that offers many alternatives. Orchestration Fundamentals: Beyond Tool Names Before diving into tools, let&#8217;s talk about what orchestration actually means. This helped a lot when I was getting started: understanding that knowledge can be transferred and that you can break down the orchestration approach into layers. Note that this won&#8217;t deep dive into exclusive c...

I recently tried to light the tinder for what I hoped would be a revolt &#8212; the&nbsp; Single Node Rebellion &#8212; but , of course, it sputtered out immediately. Truth be told, it was one of the most popular articles I&#8217;ve written about in some time , purely based on the stats. The fact that I even sold t-shirts , tells me I have born a few acolytes into this troubled Lake House world. Without rehashing the entire article, it&#8217;s clear that there is what I would call &#8220; cluster fatigue. &#8221; We all know it, but never talk about it &#8230; much &#8230; running SaaS Lake Houses is expensive emotionally and financially. All well and good during the peak Covid days when we had our mini dot-com bubble, but the air has gone out of that one. Not only is it not cheap to crunch 650 GB of data on a Spark cluster &#8212;piling up DBUs, truth be told &#8212; but it&#8217;s not complicated either; they&#8217;ve made it easy to spend money. Especially when you simply don&#8217;t need a cluster anymore for *most datasets and workloads. Sure, in the days of Pandas when that was our only non-Spark option, we didn&#8217;t have a choice, but DuckDB, Polars, and Daft ( also known as D.P.D. because why not ) &#8230; have laid that argument to rest in a shallow grave. Cluster fatigue is real D.P.D. can work on LTM ( larger than memory ) datasets D.P.D. is extremely fast.

A Conversation Between Strangers Last Thursday, returning home from Washington, D.C., on the late train to Princeton, I found my seat occupied by a gentleman in his seventies. He was traveling with his wife, surrounded by four large suitcases, the kind meant for international journeys. The bags had wheels at the bottom, and he was holding onto them with evident concern. Photographer: Anne Hollowday | Camera: CineStill 800Tungsten, Kodak Ektar 100, Ilford Delta 3200 Anyone who has traveled on Amtrak knows the problem: the trains lack proper restraining mechanisms for large luggage. Without someone holding them, those wheeled bags would roll across the aisle with every curve in the track. As a good Samaritan, I offered to help secure a couple of them. We struck up a conversation. When I asked what he did for a living, he said he was retired but had worked in LPI, or Low Probability of Intercept . I had never heard the term. He explained it succinctly: A class of radar and communication technologies designed to evade detection, used primarily in defense systems but with some commercial applications. In under a minute, he had compressed decades of expertise into a crisp, accessible explanation. I was impressed. Then he turned the question back to me. So what does AI actually do? How does it change lives? I felt the pressure immediately. Here was a man who had just distilled a complex defense technology into sixty seconds. His wife was gathering their belongings. The train was approaching their stop. As a technology executive, I needed to compress this massive, sprawling concept into something equally elegant. My mind raced through metaphors. And then it struck me: AI was much like the invention of the wheel. As the couple prepared to disembark, rolling their wheeled bags toward the exit, the metaphor seemed almost too perfect. He now had a fresh perspective on the casters beneath his luggage, those simple rotating mechanisms that trace their lineage back five thousand y...

## Post 43: AI-Ready Data vs. Analytics-Ready Data

Before we dive in, we want to take a moment to thank you for being here with us as we step into 2026! The Modern Data 101 community exists because of your curiosity, your ideas, and your willingness to think more deeply about data. We&#8217;ll continue to share the best resources, emerging ideas, and important pivots shaping the modern data world, and we hope you&#8217;ll stay with us not just through 2026 but for many years to come. A Very Happy New Year! &#129346; Now, Let&#8217;s Dive In! Before we talk about modern data, or AI-ready data, we have to step back and ask a much older question: what is data fundamentally for? Strip away the platforms, the pipelines, the dashboards, and the acronyms, and data resolves into something far simpler. Data exists to reduce uncertainty, support decisions, and ultimately enable action. Everything else we build on top of it is secondary. If the goal changes, the properties of the data must change as well. Data is not inherently &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; in isolation. It is only good relative to the problem it is meant to solve. Reusing the same shape of data for fundamentally different goals is not efficiency but category error. Which brings us to the only question that actually matters: what kind of uncertainty are we trying to reduce? The moment that answer changes, the meaning of readiness changes with it. And that is where the divergence between analytics-ready data and AI-ready data begins. What does &#8216;ready&#8217; mean The word &#8220;ready&#8221; sounds deceptively simple. But ready for whom? Ready for what? Data readiness is often spoken about as if it were a universal state: something data either is or isn&#8217;t. In reality, &#8220;ready&#8221; has no meaning unless we first define the context in which the data is meant to operate. To understand readiness, we have to decompose it. Who is consuming the data? How is it being consumed? What kinds of decisions does it exist to support? And perhaps mos...

Alongside stellar strategies and impactful data governance wins, Tiankai&#8217;s way of expression, delivery, and evangelism strikes a chord that most of us in the data space never expected: to be reminded of that childlike learning bug. Below are the top ten quality hits and behind the scenes from the man himself. Get your records on! Top 5 Hits by @KaiFeng &amp; Exclusive Behind the Scenes! Data - The Musical &#127925; This parody medley of Broadway musicals blends a humorous self-introduction with a playful, musical take on the daily madness of data work. It drops quirky takes (&#8220; You&#8217;ll be back, soon you&#8217;ll see, coz your user story&#8217;s not complete &#8221;), fun biographical deets, and great storytelling to poke fun at the hyper-structured world of data people. The lighthearted tone sets up the message: &#8230;even though data governance, rules, and cleaning can look intimidating, the passion for data and the shared struggle are what bring the community together. The humour works because it exaggerates the seriousness of data life while showing how human and relatable it really is. The song highlights the hard realities of data, like endless lines to review, missing context, lost documentation, and the eternal search for KPIs that live &#8220;somewhere.&#8221; It makes fun of relying on Excel, the fact that not everyone knows SQL, and the universal pain of waiting for business input. Yet beneath the jokes is a sincere emphasis that data literacy, collaboration, and joint ownership are the only path to true &#8220;data democracy,&#8221; and it can be unforgiving. Blending comedy with truth, the song celebrates the data professionals, acknowledges their frustrations, and encourages everyone to learn, particip...

Let&#8217;s dive in When it comes to Data Quality, there is a standard piece of advice: &#8220;The business side must own the data.&#8221; We are told that every data initiative needs to be tied to a business use case, and the business should own the data issues. While true, this advice often fails to solve the real problem. Why? Because simply telling a business leader that data quality matters doesn&#8217;t automatically make them want to fix it. Knowing something is important is different from doing something about it. Action is hard. It feels uncertain, disruptive, and uncomfortable. Inaction, on the other hand, feels safe.

## Post 46: Rethinking Data Movement: A First Principles Approach

TOC Why Data Movement Needs a Rethink The Problem: Legacy Ingestion at Scale The Triple Squeeze on Data Teams Common Challenges of Data Movement Broader Operational Complexities The Shift: The Principles of Modern Data Movement How a Data Movement Engine Embodies the Principles The Architecture of Modern Data Movement Deep-Dives into Modern Data Movement Patterns Why Data Movement Needs a Rethink Data used to be simple: a handful of databases, nightly batch jobs, and reports waiting in the morning. Today, that world is invalid. Today, every enterprise is drowning in sources that won&#8217;t stop multiplying: relational databases, SaaS APIs, log files, event streams, you name it. Each comes with its own quirks, schemas, and update patterns. At the same time, the patience window has collapsed . Business stakeholders don&#8217;t want yesterday&#8217;s snapshot, they expect dashboards that refresh in near-real time. Product teams want features powered by streaming data. AI initiatives demand low-latency, constantly refreshed context. SLAs rise, and tolerance for lag drops to near zero. We&#8217;ve thrown brute force at this problem before. The Spark-era mindset was: spin up clusters, crunch everything in sight, reload the warehouse from scratch. But that model doesn&#8217;t scale when your sources are infinite, your SLAs are tighter than ever, and your cost curve is under constant pressure. This is why the centre of gravity has shifted. Modern data movement is not about &#8220;big batch compute.&#8221; It&#8217;s about: Incremental-first pipelines that move only what&#8217;s changed. Change Data Capture (CDC) that keeps systems in sync without heavy lifting. API-aware connectors that respect rate limits, pagination, and quirks of SaaS ecosystems. Observability baked in , so teams can see, debug, and trust their pipelines end-to-end. That&#8217;s the new playbook. Without it, everything else, like your analytics, your AI, your customer experience, suffers. The Problem: L...

Let&#8217;s Dive In For years, data was merely a technical component of applications, a simple support mechanism for maintenance. Today, it has taken on a new dimension: it has become a product with its own uses, requirements, and lifecycle. However, most data systems still act like fragile pipelines: They break as soon as business rules change Every update is costly They fail quietly without proper monitoring They constantly need someone to fix them. These situations have shaped a clear conviction: The real challenge today is to design systems that adapt, preserve trust, and remain coherent as the business evolves. A robust data product is therefore much more than a workflow. It is a long-lived digital asset that encodes business meaning, enforces data quality, traces change, and supports continuous evolution without friction. In this article, I&#8217;m laying out five engineering pillars that I&#8217;ve seen consistently turn data products from...

## Post 48: AI and Data are Business Strategy Experiments Now. How Far Are You Willing to Push the Curve?

**Publication:** Modern Data 101
**Author:** Travis Thompson

In data products, people often use &#8216;data risk&#8217; and &#8216;data experimentation&#8217; as if they mean the same thing. They are different, though, and mixing them up is a big reason why many organisations struggle to achieve real results with AI or analytics . The difference may seem small, but it separates teams that just keep data flowing from those that create lasting value with their data products. Data Risk Data risk means your assumptions, models, or understanding of the business could be off in ways you might not notice. This can lead to wrong decisions, mismatched metrics, or loss of trust. However, risk also presents opportunities for disproportionate gains. Strategic decisions embedded within models (such as definitions, granularity, dimensions, and transformations) can later yield sustainable competitive advantages. Data risk is the necessary cost of developing enduring digital assets rather than temporary dashboards. Data Experimentation Data experimentation is about discovering new things. It means looking at real business behaviours instead of just trusting assumptions. This could involve trying new data transformations, testing different features, tracking data flows, watching how people use data, and exploring unusual data connections. Experimentation focuses on learning and finding benefits, not just avoiding risks or chasing quick results. How do data risk and experimentation work together, and where does real impact come from? Consider a graph with experimentation velocity on the x-axis and data risk exposure on the y-axis . Influence of Risk and Experimentation Assets on Impact of Data Teams | Source: MD101 Archives Zone A: The Data Product R&amp;D Lab Strong data teams start here, moving quickly, running experiments that are safe to fail, and learning a lot about their data. They map out data, improve metrics, test connections, and check how users behave. At this stage, the rest of the company is not relying on your data definitions y...

## Post 49: Reflecting the Language Instinct in Machines

**Publication:** Modern Data 101
**Author:** Animesh Kumar

**Published:** 2025-12-04T15:16:33+00:00

**Content Preview:**
Language, they say, is an instinct instead of a learned skill. There&#8217;s a whole book on it if you&#8217;re interested. Essentially, the idea is that while language is a wrapper, the base instinct is the need to communicate. Initially, for evolutionary reasons (humans survived because of communicating survival strategies), later, to also simply express for the sake of beauty and art. Now that we have such huge advancements in the field of language, where academia and technology have joined hands to unify the limits of ontology, semantics, and communication, we must understand the base instinct of this capability to really excel. Book recommendation: The Language Instinct, by Steven Pinker What is the Base Instinct of Language Need to unify with other seemingly isolated entities. Humans have separate consciousnesses; how must they meet, even if at a shallow level? Through communication, which is interaction. We call these interoperable exchanges &#8216;discussions,&#8217; &#8216;brainstorming,&#8217; &#8216;meetings,&#8217; and the like. What about entities that haven&#8217;t developed the language wrapper? The wilderness hosts countless such beings. Everything, including plants, trees, and animals of the wild. However, they too share the common base instinct: to interact. Interaction is one of the foundational keys of survival, even in civil societies. The moment there&#8217;s even a hint of it being taken away, it&#8217;s a dystopia. Trees are known to interact through roots, scent, animals. In one particular adventure, I came across the idea of the &#8220;wood wide web:&#8221; a network so grand that it could easily beat any latest technology. These are evolutionary results of entities who have existed since long before us and instead of developing language as wrapper on the base instinct of interoperability, they went with other means. The revelation of the Wood Wide Web&#8217;s existence, and the increased understanding of its functions, raises big questions...

His brilliance didn&#8217;t lie in cataloguing the 63 known elements, but in foreseeing what must exist beyond them. He left deliberate gaps, placeholders for the undiscovered entities, trusting the coherence of his framework more than the completeness of his data. Years later, when gallium, scandium, and germanium filled those spaces exactly as he predicted, the framework itself was validated.

The goal of a data platform is not to capture the present, but to anticipate the future and build a schema of possibility .

Significance of Purpose and Lineage in developing explain a ble and embedded Governance in data stacks (for illustration purposes only) | Source: Authors The systems we admire at Meta , Google , or Netflix are physical artefacts of an organisation&#8217;s design philosophy: the accumulated expression of how these organisations think about data, software, responsibility, and scale. What we see on the outside is only the final shape of decades of internal reasoning. Enterprises make the mistake of following in the footsteps of these advanced data- and tech-first orgs to replicate the same business shape. They adopt the warehouse-lakehouse-governance stack, the &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; privacy tooling, pick as-is catalogs and create the same views, probably replicate mesh-inspired domains, and believe they have reconstructed a high-functioning data infrastructure. But replicating the visible layers without reflecting the enterprise&#8217;s operating logic is a high-cost mirage. The tools may look contemporary, but the underlying behaviour and how they interact with each other and data entities still reflect legacy constraints. This is why so many transformations end up feeling hollow . The architecture appears modern when diagrammed, yet it behaves exactly like the old one when work flows through it. The problem is not that enterprises are missing a particular tool or framework. The problem is that they are copying an artefact without understanding its cause.

## Post 54: The Network is the Product: Data Network Flywheel, Compound Through Connection

**Publication:** Modern Data 101
**Author:** Animesh Kumar

**Published:** 2025-11-17T18:29:19+00:00

**Content Preview:**
The Law of Data Systems: Everything Compounds When It Connects The value of a data product is never contained within its boundaries. It emerges from the number, quality, and friction of its connections, and the signals from its produce. Connectivity is the architecture that turns isolated signals into coordinated intelligence. The mistake most teams make is assuming insight comes from accumulation, when in reality it comes from interaction. The system becomes &#8220;intelligent&#8221; when the surface area of interaction between components expands. It&#8217;s not from the sophistication of isolated components. Intelligence is an emergent property of the feedback loops between producers, consumers, and the decisions that reshape the system in return. Where interaction is narrow, intelligence stays local. Where interaction grows, intelligence compounds. Without the network effect built into the earliest stages of strategy, organisations trap themselves in linear architectures that can never produce nonlinear outcomes. They add more resources but get diminishing returns because the underlying system doesn&#8217;t compound. Source: LinkedIn And this is where the Data Network Flywheel truly begins. When every data product learns from every other, when every interaction strengthens the next, the system stops being a cost centre and is a self-accelerating engine of value. Quadrants of Value: The Data Product Amplification Matrix The Amplification Matrix isn&#8217;t a maturity model, but one that helps us understand how a system evolves as its internal connections deepen. Each quadrant represents a distinct state of system behaviour: how information flows, how meaning accumulates, and how value compounds.

Jump to Masterclass About Host: Mahdi Karabiben, Head of Product Mahdi has been working in the data space for more than eight years and is presently the Senior Product Manager at Sifflet, which builds data observability. Formerly, he was a Staff Data Engineer at Zendesk, working on the company&#8217;s Data Platform. Mahdi has dabbled in multiple industries and organisations, working with different types of data, all in the context of building petabyte-scale data platforms . The constant across these experiences was the scale of data and building competent platforms and tools that managed that scale. Below is a detailed overview of Mahdi&#8217;s session, which should give you a taste of the concepts he touches on, his drive and emphasis on why fundamentals of data modelling suffice the innovation that data products bring to the modern data infrastructure, essentially eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel. Let&#8217;s Dive In Data modelling, at its core, is the act of giving data shape and constraints so that it becomes reliable reasoning material. It defines how concepts relate, how meaning propagates, and how systems preserve truth across change. A data product, in contrast, is not a table or a dashboard; it is a reusable and measurable asset engineered with the discipline of product thinking: versioned, owned, and designed for a specific outcome. We are once again at an inflexion point. In the 1990s, centralised data warehouses and dimensional models gave organisations consistency and trust. The Hadoop era traded that trust for scale: data was everywhere, but meaning was nowhere. The modern data stack made infrastructure effortless, but encouraged ad hoc pipelines that decayed faster than they created value. Now, the pendulum is swinging back toward decentralisation, where domains own their data, models are built around value streams, and governance mu...

It&#8217;s ironically the human at the centre of the equation. Enterprises have spent the last decade industrialising their data infrastructure, yet their human infrastructure remains analogue. AI fails in large enterprise setups because organisations cannot change how they think . Beneath the surface of every failed initiative is the same pattern: change fatigue, tool overload, and fragmented accountability. Systems evolve faster than the people operating them. The outcome: a widening adoption gap where the brilliance of technology is dulled by the inertia of behaviour. The Generative Turn (GT) has amplified this tension. AI has moved from the back office to the front line: from automating processes to augmenting decisions. This transition demands trust, which is ten steps ahead of merely demanding integration. To deploy AI effectively, enterprises must engineer deliberate pathways that help users perceive, understand, and internalise AI&#8217;s role in their workflow. From first principles, every AI transformation is a story of human transformation. Data managers may prepare the ground, but change managers grow the roots. AI success is 20% model performance and 80% organisational adoption. Stakeholder Mapping and Influence Analysis Every AI transformation begins with a paradox: the people ...

In 2025 the best way to manage Python projects is using uv . This tutorial helps you set up a modern Python project from scratch using uv. Yep, correct spelling is uv , two lower-case letters. The two most important things that uv manages for you is a project-specific virtual environment (venv), and all the project dependencies in that venv. Let&#8217;s start creating stuff! Install uv If you haven&#8217;t already, install uv on your machine. Open a shell or terminal to run these commands: On MacOS, make sure you have Homebrew installed , then run brew install uv to install uv. On Linux, run curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh to install uv. On Windows, run powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &#8220;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&#8221; to install uv. (Otherwise consult the uv installation docs ). Make sure you have uv installed and available as a command line application. You should be able to open a new shell and run the following command: $ uv --version uv 0.9.5 (Homebrew 2025-10-21) By the time you read this, uv will be updated many times, so you should expect to see a newer version. Create a project with uv Let&#8217;s create a personal Python project for you using uv. In this example we&#8217;ll pretend you&#8217;re caled &#8220;Alice&#8221; and use that as an example. Feel free to sub Alice with your own name or whatever name you want to use for this project. Let&#8217;s open the shell again, and create a project folder. After that let&#8217;s change into that folder and run all further commands inside that folder. mkdir -p alice-python cd alice-python (On Windows use Powershell, and you can omit the -p flag to mkdir .) We&#8217;ll uv init to initialize the project. Run uv init --help to see the available options. $ uv init --name alice-python --python 3.13 --description &#8220;Alice&#8217;s personal Python project&#8221; Initialized project `alice-python` (Again, you can use your own name and description instead of Alice.)

A bit about our guest author: Hugo Bowne- Anderson advises and teaches teams building LLM-powered systems, including engineers from Netflix, Meta, and the United Nations through my course on the AI software development lifecycle . It covers everything from retrieval and evaluation to agent design and all the steps in between. Use the code MARVELOUS25 for 25% off. In a recent Vanishing Gradients podcast, I sat down with John Berryman, an early engineer on GitHub Copilot and author of Prompt Engineering for LLMs . We framed a practical discussion around the &#8220;Seven Deadly Sins of AI App Development,&#8221; identifying common failure modes that derail projects. For each sin, we offer a &#8220;penance&#8221;: a clear antidote for building more robust and reliable AI systems. You can also listen to this as a podcast: Spotify Apple Full notes and more episodes &#128073; This was a guest Q&amp;A from our July cohort of Building AI Applications for Data Scientists and Software Engineers. Enrolment is open for our next cohort (starting November 3) . &#128072; Sin 1: Demanding 100% Accuracy The first sin is building an AI product with the expectation that it must be 100% accurate, especially in high-stakes domains like legal or medical documentation [ 00:03:15 ]. This mindset treats a probabilistic system like deterministic software, a mismatch that leads to unworkable project requirements and potential liability issues. The sin is requiring these AI systems to be more accurate than you would require a human to be. The Solution/Penance: Reframe the problem. The goal is not to replace human judgment but to save users time. Design systems that make the AI&#8217;s work transparent, allowing users to verify the output and act as the final authority. By setting the correct expectation, that the AI is a time-saving assistant, not an infallible oracle, you can deliver value without overpromising on reliability [ 00:04:30 ]. Sin 2: Granting Agents Too Much Autonomy This sin invo...

If you&#8217;ve ever built a machine learning model in a Jupyter notebook and wondered &#8220;Now what?&#8221;, you&#8217;re not alone. The gap between a working prototype and a production ML system is big, filled with infrastructure complexity, deployment challenges, and monitoring nightmares. That&#8217;s why we created a free, hands-on MLOps course using Databricks Free Edition. A guide we wish we&#8217;d had when starting out with MLOps on Databricks. Marvelous MLOps Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. With 3 hours of video lessons and 10 detailed Substack lectures, this course takes you from zero to a production-ready ML pipeline. You&#8217;ll master automated deployment with Databricks Asset Bundles and GitHub Actions, and set up monitoring with drift detection to keep your models reliable over time. To make things more fun, we built our use case using a toy dataset around Marvel characters, after all, we&#8217;re big fans of the universe. The 3-hour course is now available as a single video on YouTube: The 10-lecture journey Here&#8217;s the full collection of articles so you can explore them easily: Lecture 1: Introduction to MLOps We start with the hard truth: most ML projects never make it to production. Why? Because moving from a 1000-line notebook to a scalable system requires a completely different mindset. Lecture 2: Developing on Databricks We show why notebooks are great for exploration but become bottlenecks for MLOps. They make it difficult to write modular code, apply code quality standards, or run unit tests. We&#8217;ll show you how to use VS Code extension, Databricks CLI, and Databricks Connect to develop locally with modern engineering workflows while running PySpark code on Databricks. Lecture 3: Getting started with MLflow Dive deep into the two most important MLflow classes: `mlflow.entities.Experiment` and `mlflow.entities.Run`. These form the f...

Watch the lecture on YouTube. In the previous lecture , we covered the theory behind ML model monitoring and the tools Databricks provides for it. In this session, we&#8217;ll walk through a practical example, from inference tables to Lakehouse Monitoring implementation. Our monitoring system consists of four key components: Inference Logging: Capturing model inputs and outputs Monitoring Table Creation: Transforming raw logs into a format suitable for monitoring Scheduled Refreshes: Keeping monitoring data up-to-date Monitoring Dashboard: Visualizing metrics and detecting drift Let&#8217;s examine each component in detail. 1. Inference Data Collection !Make sure that inference tables is enabled for your serving endpoint. First, we need to collect data from our model serving endpoint. The notebook lecture10.marvel_create_monitoring_table.py demonstrates how to send requests to our endpoint and then process the logged data. In lecture 6 , we learned how to call the model endpoint. There are two ways to do this: either via HTTPS or by using the Workspace Client. def send_request_https(dataframe_record): """ Sends a request to the model serving endpoint using HTTPS.

This article is part of that course series, where we walk through the tools, patterns, and best practices for building and deploying machine learning workflows on Databricks. In this lecture, we&#8217;ll dive into one of the most critical (and often misunderstood) aspects of production ML: monitoring. Watch the lecture on Youtube: In a ML system, you need to monitor metrics that go beyond the ones you&#8217;d expect in any production system (such as system health, errors, and latency, KPIs and infrastructure costs). In classic software, if code, data, and environment stay the same, so does behavior. ML systems are different: model performance can degrade even if nothing changes in your code or infra because ML is driven by the statistical properties of your data. User behavior can shift, seasonality or upstream data can change. All can cause your model to underperform, even if everything else is &#8220;the same.&#8221; That&#8217;s why MLOps monitoring includes data drift, model drift, and statistical health, not just system metrics. Data Drift: It happens when the distribution of the input data shifts over time, even if the relationship between inputs and outputs stays the same. For example, let&#8217;s say there is a lot of new houses entering the market in a certain district. People&#8217;s preferences, the relationship between features and price stays the same. But because the model hasn&#8217;t seen enough examples of new houses, its performance drops, not because the logic changed, but because the data shifted. In this case, data drift is the root cause of model degradation. Concept Drift: It happens when the relationship between input features and the target variable changes over time so model&#8217;s original assumptions about how inputs relate to outputs no longer holds. Let&#8217;s look at housing prices example: new houses e...

This article is part of that course series, where we walk through the tools, patterns, and best practices for building and deploying machine learning workflows on Databricks. Watch lecture 8 on Youtube: In this lecture, we&#8217;ll explore how to structure your data and assets for robust, secure, and scalable machine learning operations on Databricks, and how to automate deployments using CI/CD pipelines. Unity Catalog, Workspaces, and Data Organization We&#8217;ve already interacted with Unity Catalog, using it to create delta tables and register models. For a workspace to use Unity Catalog, it must be attached to a Unity Catalog metastore, which is the top-level container for all data and AI asset metadata. You can only have one metastore per cloud region, and each workspace can only be attached to one metastore in that region. Unity Catalog organizes assets in a three-tier hierarchy: Catalogs (e.g., mlops_dev, mlops_acc, mlops_prd) Schemas within catalogs (in our case, we have the same schema name in each catalog, marvel_characters) Assets within schemas (tables, views, models, etc.) Assets are referenced using a three-part naming convention: catalog.schema.asset. Access Control: Securables and Permissions In Databricks, permissions can be set on the workspace and on Unity Catalog level. Workspace-level securables: Notebooks, clusters, jobs &#8212; accessed via ACLs. Unity Catalog-level securables : Tables, schemas, models &#8212; accessed via metastore-level privileges. Workspace binding and access modes: if the catalog has OPEN mode, it can be accessed from any workspace. Use ISOLATED mode to control cross-project access. In a typical setup, an ML project or team has a set of Databricks workspaces (dev, acc, and prd), and set of catalogs or schemas within a larger catalog. In the course example, for simplicity we use a shared wor...

In this lecture, we&#8217;ll focus on how to automate and the entire ML workflow using DAB. You can also follow along with the full walkthrough on the Marvelous MLOps YouTube channel: All code covered in this repository is available here . Why Databricks Asset Bundles? When deploying resources and their dependencies on Databricks, you have a few options: Terraform: Full infrastructure-as-code control, but can be complex. Databricks APIs: Flexible, but requires custom scripting. Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB): The recommended, declarative, YAML-based approach. DAB offers a balance between simplicity and power. Under the hood, it leverages Terraform, so you get all the benefits of infrastructure-as-code, without having to manage raw Terraform code yourself. This is ideal for teams looking to standardize and automate job deployments in a scalable, maintainable way. What is DAB? Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) is the way to package your code, jobs, configuration, and dependencies together in a structured, version-controlled format. With DAB, you define jobs, notebooks, models, and their dependencies using YAML files. Key features: Declarative YAML configuration: Define everything in one place. Multi-environment support: Easily target dev, staging, prod, etc. CI/CD friendly: Fits naturally into automated pipelines. Version-controlled: All changes are tracked in your repo. What is a Lekeflow job? Lakeflow Jobs (previously Databricks workflows) provide the execution and orchestration layer. Workflows let you run tasks (notebooks, scripts, SQL) on a schedule or in response to events, with support for dependencies, retries, parameter passing, and alerts. Machine learning pi...

You can also follow along with the full walkthrough on the Marvelous MLOps YouTube channel. In previous lectures, you learned how to train, log, and register models with MLflow. Now, it&#8217;s time to expose those models behind an API using Databricks Model Serving. Databricks Model Serving is a fully managed, serverless solution that allows you to deploy MLflow models as RESTful APIs without the need to set up or manage any infrastructure. Effortless deployment of registered MLflow models Automatic scaling, including scale-to-zero when there&#8217;s no traffic Built-in monitoring in the Databricks UI (track latency, throughput, error rates) Seamless integration with models registered in Unity Catalog Model serving limitations Databricks model serving makes the transition from experimentation to production incredibly smooth. It&#8217;s ideal for teams who want to focus on building great models, not managing infrastructure. However, if you choose to deploy a model serving endpoint on Databricks, you must be aware of its limitations, such as: No control over runtime environment: Databricks chooses the environment for you, which can be a constraint if you need specific library versions. No control over cluster size. Each replica is limited to 4 GB RAM (CPU), which may not be enough for very large models. Workload size options: You can choose the workload size (Small, Medium, Large, XL, etc.), which determines the number of compute units per replica. For demanding use cases, you can scale up to 512 units per endpoint on request. The work...

This article is part of the course series, where we walk through the tools, patterns, and best practices for building and deploying machine learning workflows on Databricks. This is lecture 5, where we talk about model serving architectures on Databricks. View it on Marvelous MLOps YouTube channel: Model serving is a challenging topic for many machine learning teams. In an ideal scenario, the same team that develops a model, should be responsible for model deployment. However, this is not always feasible due to the knowledge gap or organizational structure. In that scenario, once model is ready, it is handed over to another team for deployment. It creates a lot of overhead when it comes to debugging and communication. That&#8217;s where Databricks model serving can help a lot. Databricks model and feature serving use serverless, which simplifies the infrastructure side of the deployment, and a model endpoint can be created with one Python command (using Databricks sdk). It allows data science teams to own the deployment end-to-end and minimize the dependence on other teams. In this article, we&#8217;ll discuss the following architectures: serving batch predictions (feature serving) model serving model serving with feature lookup Feature serving Serving batch predictions is probably one of the most popular and underestimated types of machine learning model deployment. Predictions are computed in advance using a batch process, stored in an SQL or in-memory database, and retrieved at request. This architecture is very popular in the case of personal recommendation with low latency requirements. For example, an e-commerce store may recommend products to customers on various pages of the website. Databricks Feature Serving is a perfect fit here. A scheduled Lakeflow job preprocesses data, retrains the model, and writes predictions to a fe...

This article is part of the course series, where we walk through the tools, patterns, and best practices for building and deploying machine learning workflows on Databricks. Let&#8217;s dive into lecture 4 where we talk about logging and registering models with MLflow. View the lecture on Marvelous MLOps YouTube channel: In the previous lecture , we have logged metrics, parameters, various artifacts, but have not logged a model yet. You could just saved a model in a .pkl file, but MLflow goes beyond that: it provides a standardized format called an MLflow Model, which defines how a model, its dependencies, and its code are stored. This is essential for downstream tasks like real-time serving, which will be covered later in the course. A model can be logged using the mlflow.&lt;model_flavor&gt;.log_model() function. MLflow supports a wide range of flavors, such as lightgbm, prophet, pytorch, sklearn, xgboost, and many more. It also supports any custom model logics through PythonModel base class , which can be logged using pyfunc flavor. Basic model: log, train, and register To demonstrate logging, we&#8217;ll start with training a scikit-learn pipeline (referred to as Basic model) and logging it using sklearn flavor. We&#8217;ll walk through the notebooks/lecture4.train_register_basic_model.py code from the course GitHub repo . Since we are interacting with MLflow, we need to set up tracking and registry URIs just as we did in lecture 3 : import mlflow import os from dotenv import load_dotenv def is_databricks(): return "DATABRICKS_RUNTIME_VERSION" in os.environ if not is_databricks(): load_dotenv() profile = os.environ["PROFILE"] mlflow.set_tracking_uri(f"databricks://{profile}") mlflow.set_registry_uri(f"databricks-uc://{profile}") Then we&#8217;ll load the project configuration, initialize the SparkSession, and define tags we&#8217...

Let&#8217;s dive into lecture 3, where we talk about MLflow experiment tracking. View the lecture on Marvelous MLOps YouTube channel: MLflow is probably the most popular tool for model registry and experiment tracking out there. MLFlow is open source and integrates with a lot of platforms and tools. Due to its extensive support and a lot of options, getting started with MLflow may feel overwhelming. In this lecture, we will get back to the basics, and will review 2 most important classes in MLFlow that form the foundation of everything else , mlflow.entities.Experiment and mlflow.entities.Run. We will see how those entities get created, how you can retrieve them, and how they change based on different input parameters. In this course, the Databricks version of MLflow is used, so it contains some Databricks-specific information. However, the idea is generalizable to any MLflow instance. Before we go any further, let&#8217;s discuss how we can authenticate towards MLflow tracking server on Databricks. Tracking URI By default, MLflow will track experiment runs using the local file systems, and all the metadata will be stored in the ./mlruns directory. We can verify that by retrieving the current tracking URI: import mlflow mlflow.get_tracking_uri() In lecture 2 , we explained how we can authenticate towards Databricks using Databricks CLI, which we continued to use when developing in VS Code. Now we must make MLflow aware of it, and use Databricks MLflow tracking server. This can be done by calling mlflow.set_tracking_uri(). Even though we&#8217;re only using experiment tracking for now, starting with MLflow 3, it&#8217;s also necessary to set the registry URI using...

This article is part of the course series, where we walk through the tools, patterns, and best practices for building and deploying machine learning workflows on Databricks. Let&#8217;s dive into lecture 2, where we talk about developing on Databricks. View the lecture on Marvelous MLOps YouTube channel: Most people using Databricks start by developing directly in a Databricks notebook, because it&#8217;s easy, fast, and convenient. But when it comes to MLOps, that convenience can quickly become a bottleneck. Notebooks make it difficult to write modular code, apply proper code quality standards, or run unit tests, all of which are essential for maintainable, production-grade ML systems. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a better way. Databricks developer tools, such as VS Code extension , Databricks CLI , and Databricks Connect, allow you to develop locally using modern engineering workflows, while still running your pyspark code on Databricks. In this lecture, we&#8217;ll show you how to use these tools to move development outside notebooks and adopt workflows that align better with MLOps practices. Getting started To follow along with the course, you&#8217;ll need to set up a few things. In the video, we demonstrate how to walk through these steps. 1. Get the Databricks free edition. The course uses Databricks free edition . Do not confuse it with Databricks free trial, it is not the same thing! 2. Fork the course repo: https://github.com/marvelousmlops/marvel-characters . Forking the repo will allow you to work on CI/CD pipeline later in the course. Clone the forked repo on your local machine 3. Create catalogs and schemas. In the Databricks free edition workspace, create catalogs mlops_dev, mlops_acc, and mlops_prd. Under each catalog, create schema marvel_characters.

This article is part of the course series, where we walk through the tools, patterns, and best practices for building and deploying machine learning workflows on Databricks : Lecture 1: Introduction to MLOPs Lecture 2: Developing on Databricks Lecture 3: Getting started with MLflow Lecture 4: Log and register model with MLflow Lecture 5: Model serving architectures Lecture 6: Deploying model serving endpoint Lecture 7: Databricks Asset Bundles Lecture 8: CI/CD and deployment strategies Lecture 9: Intro to monitoring Lecture 10: Lakehouse monitoring Let&#8217;s dive into lecture 1. View the lecture recording on Marvelous MLOps YouTube: If you&#8217;ve worked with machine learning in a real-world setting, you&#8217;ve likely heard the term MLOps . According to Wikipedia: &#8220;MLOps is a paradigm that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.&#8221; But what does production actually mean in this context? In practice, production means that the output of a machine learning model is consistently delivered to end users or systems ,and that it drives real business value. Here&#8217;s a simple example: A data scientist is asked to build a demand forecasting model. They develop a proof of concept in a Databricks notebook, more than a thousand lines of code, that trains a model, generates predictions, and writes those predictions to a Delta table. That Delta table is then used by the fulfillment team to order products. Since forecasts need to be updated weekly, the data scientist schedules the notebook to run once a week. Is this in production? Yes. The model&#8217;s outputs are actively used to support business decisions. Is it efficient? To some extent. Automating the process with a scheduled notebook is certainly more efficient than running everything manually. Is it reliable? Not really. T...

There&#8217;s a common pattern I keep seeing, and honestly, it&#8217;s frustrating. Everyone reaches for agents first. They set up memory systems. They add routing logic. They create tool definitions and character backstories. It feels powerful, and it feels like progress. Until everything breaks. And when things go wrong (which they always do), nobody can figure out why. Was it the agent forgetting its task? Is the wrong tool getting selected? Too many moving parts to debug? Is the whole system fundamentally brittle? I learned this the hard way. Six months ago, I built a &#8220;research crew&#8221; with CrewAI: three agents, five tools, perfect coordination on paper. But in practice? The researcher ignored the web scraper, the summarizer forgot to use the citation tool, and the coordinator gave up entirely when processing longer documents. It was a beautiful plan falling apart in spectacular ways. This flowchart came from one of my lessons after debugging countless broken agent systems. Notice that tiny box at the end? That&#8217;s how rarely you actually need agents. Yet everyone starts there. This post is about what I learned from those failures, including how to avoid them entirely. The patterns I&#8217;ll walk throu...

## Post 76: Using Polars in unison with Databricks Unity Catalog

The advent of Polars is not surprising given the performance it delivers. Recently, it became also possible to use external engines for consuming data from Databricks Unity Catalog (UC), which means we can read data directly into a Polars dataframe by utilizing pyarrow and Deltalake. This can be particularly useful for machine learning projects, which utilize libraries like scikit-learn that expect Pandas or Polars dataframe as an input. If the source data is stored as a delta table in Unity Catalog, a standard approach of first creating a pyspark dataframe and then transforming it into a Polars or Pandas dataframe can be very inefficient. Instead, we would like to read data from Unity Catalog without going through pyspark. Marvelous MLOps Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. In this article, we show how to achieve that. We also challenge the idea of using pyspark or spark SQL for data transformation (which is common for data preprocessing pipelines), showing that using Polars can help to achieve serious speedup and cost savings for certain data sizes. Benchmark &amp; requirements For the benchmark we used the industry standard TPC-H benchmark: https://www.tpc.org/tpch/ . The functions are the ones as used again from the repository from Polars: https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-benchmark . All the code for the article can be found in the repository . For your convenience, we made all the data available via a shared folder and prepared the scripts to dump the files in a Volume, and create the external tables with the feature of deleteVectors turned off. You can run the notebooks yourself to experience the difference in performance with minimal effort. These are the steps: Clone the repository into your Databricks workspace using the Git folder feature . It is a public repository, so you do not have to authenticate Update project_config file to use your preferred catalog and ...

## Post 77: How to debug ML deployments 20x faster

Real-time model serving is an aspect of MLOps that most machine learning teams still struggle with. Often, the deployment part is outsourced to the DevOps team, and the machine learning team is responsible for the model training and handing over the model artifact. This split of responsibilities (especially if teams have different targets) is not ideal: changes in the model training code would mean that the deployment part also needs to be adjusted, which requires a lot of coordination between the teams. We believe that the machine learning teams should be responsible for machine learning model deployment end-to-end. However, they often lack the skills, especially when it comes to the real-time model serving. Luckily, there are tools that aim to simplify that part of the deployment, if you are a Databricks user. Databricks model serving is worth considering for that purpose: models can be deployed with minimal code using Python SDK, given that the model training is tracked using MLflow and registered in Unity Catalog. Marvelous MLOps Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. It all sounds simple, but has a downside: if something is wrong with your deployment (especially if you are using a custom model), you will only see it after you have waited for 15-20 minutes. Very time-consuming (and expensive) interaction cycle&#8230; But it does not have to be that way! Databricks model serving utilizes MLflow model serving , which means, you can also test it locally. Source: official MLflow documentation, https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/deployment/index.html In this article, we&#8217;ll demonstrate the local testing workflow using the well-known Iris-Species dataset, focusing on three critical steps: Download a pyfunc model artifact from MLflow experiment tracking. Deploy the model endpoint locally. Test the endpoint. Before we proceed with these steps, let&#8217;s walk through the prereq...

Unicorns and Rainbows. Is it a metaphor? Is it a reality? Maybe both. Think of an unicorn dancing on top of a radiant rainbow. But, in fact, what does it mean? Image generated by AI Humanity has always been drawn to utopia &#8202;&#8212;&#8202;a perfect, idealized future where all problems are solved. Believing that the world is steadily marching toward this vision is tempting. In the AI landscape, the unicorn (you have noticed the 5th leg , right?) represents the elevated promises, wild imagination, and relentless hype that paint a picture of transformative, almost magical technology. Marvelous MLOps Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The rainbow, however, represents the real world: entire potential but riddled with imperfections, inconsistencies, and systemic barriers. Just like the stock market, AI has its declines and flows. Everything might seem to skyrocket, but a slight shift&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;technical debt, regulatory burdens, or enterprise realities&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;can send it crashing back to earth. The question is not whether AI is a transformative force (there is no doubt it is!) but whether we&#8217;re being realistic about its trajectory. This article will discuss the reality of using AI in the enterprise environment, address technical debt, bridge knowledge gaps, and understand the herd effect that fuels the AI bubble. We aim to offer a realistic roadmap for businesses navigating the complex AI landscape by critically analyzing these factors. 1. The AI bubble We have been in Data &amp; AI for over 10 years. The AI bubble has never been so big. We have AI everywhere on our laptops, phones, and websites. The CEOs of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI are spreading a lot of news about revolutionary AI technology, how AI agents will replace humans, how we will reach AGI soon, and how we will have AI everywhere.

Developing on Databricks outside of Databricks environment is challenging, and there are 4 main developer tools Databricks provides: Databricks CLI: a command line interface that allows you to interact with Databricks platform. It is a very powerful tool with a large range of commands (essentially, all the functionality available via API or Terraform is also available via CLI). Databricks asset bundles: developers tools that allow you to simplify deployment of various assets on Databricks. Databricks bundle commands are part of the CLI. Check out a related article . Databricks Connect&#8202; &#8212;&#8202;a Python package (there is also support for Scala and R) that allows you to trigger an execution of spark code on a Databricks cluster from a local environment Databricks VS Code Extension &#8202;&#8212;&#8202;an extension that integrates with all 3 other tools: Databricks connect, Databricks asset bundles, and Databricks connect. Makes it very easy to connect to the Databricks workspace and execute your code using a Databricks cluster. In this article, we focus on Databricks CLI, Databricks Connect, and VS Code Extension. We will not go through all the features of all these tools but will share some (not very obvious) findings that hopefully will help you in your development and debugging process. Marvelous MLOps Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Databricks CLI 1. Installing the CLI. Databricks has very good documentation on how to install it: https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html From our experience, the homebrew option works great on MacOS. On Window&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;winget. Otherwise, you can always install from a source build. 2. Authentication. Databricks CLI should be used to authenticate towards Databricks from your local machine. We do not recommend using personal access tokens (from a security perspective, this is not the best option).

Author: Marvelous MLOps Last October, I had the privilege of enrolling in the newly launched MLOps Course on Databricks , led by and . Developing a project and gaining expert insights and best practices from industry leaders is always an excellent opportunity, no matter how much&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;or how little&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;you know about deploying a model into production. In this blog, I&#8217;ll walk through my capstone project. The course covered a range of topics, and, although I have experience in some of them, this was my first time using Databricks. If you are new into MLOps, I can highlight the following key learnings you will gain from the live lectures and project development: End-to-End Model Deployment on Databricks : Understand how to preprocess data, engineer features, train models, and deploy them using Databricks&#8217; platform. Feature Engineering with Databricks Feature Store : Learn how to create feature tables, implement Change Data Feed (CDF), and leverage Databricks Feature Store to ensure consistent feature computation across training and inference. Experiment Tracking with MLflow : Gain experience in tracking experiments, logging parameters, metrics, and models, and ensuring reproducibility in machine learning workflows. Model Serving Architectures : Explore different model serving architectures (feature serving, model serving, and model serving with feature lookup) to deploy models efficiently in production environments. A/B Testing for Model Comparison : Understand how to implement A/B testing to compare models with different hyperparameters and route predictions based on the model&#8217;s performance. Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB) : Learn how to manage Databricks projects using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles with Databricks Asset Bundles for automation and CI/CD.

If you are a professional software developer, 1 it is tempting. It is tempting to open Claude Code&#8212;the most popular talked-about app on today&#8217;s internet; the new Cursor ; the must-have stocking stuffer of this holiday season &#8212;and YOLO-mode an expansive new feature into your product. It is tempting to one-shot your side projects from your phone. It is tempting to throw your hardest problem at it , and let it cook. It is tempting to bookmark that famous tweet , set up five Claudes in your terminal and ten more in your browser, and go scorched earth on your backlog, until your app can do everything. It is tempting for a few reasons. One is practical: Because that is what customers want. Every customer wants every tool they use to work a little differently, or do a little more. 2 Every customer has ideas about how you can be better. Every customer uses a different combination of adjacent products, and wants integrations into all of them. And if you do things A, B, and C and integrate with partners 1 and 2, and your competitor does A, B, D, and E and integrates with 1 and 3, why not simply manifest D, E, and 3 into existence? Another reason is economic: Big is what we have to build now. If everyone can build their own made-to-measure apps&#8212; decentralized apps; personal apps; custom-designed, one-of-a-kind bespoke apps&#8212;there is no market for small conveniences or narrow delights. You can&#8217;t make a living with 1,000 true fans , because they will do it themselves. 3 So our job is to build the big projects that amateurs cannot: The agentic enterprise data platform; the all-in-one tool for email, CRM, project management, and more; the revolution that generates &#8220; infinite revenue .&#8221; When anyone can create software, it is tempting to believe that the difference between a business and a hobby is simply a matter of scale. 4 The third temptation is emotional: Blasting through fresh powder is fun. 5 Nothing is more satisfying to a softw...

Some time earlier this year, I found myself, maybe, 1 interviewing at a &#8220;major AI company&#8221; that builds a &#8220;popular AI chatbot.&#8221; At some point during the conversation, we had an uneasy exchange: Them : If you were working here as a data analyst, how would you classify users&#8217; conversations with our chatbot? How would you figure out if people were using it for work or their personal lives? How would you figure out what sort of work they did? How would you infer the tasks that they were trying to accomplish? Me : Well, um, this is going to sound stupid, but&#8230;I&#8217;d probably ask [your popular chatbot service] to do it? Give it the user&#8217;s conversation, and ask it, &#8220;Does this sound like a message about work, or not?&#8221; Them: &#8230; Me: I mean, no, you&#8217;re right, you&#8217;re asking me a question about nuanced analysis, and I said, have you tried pasting everything in a text box? That was dumb. Them : &#8230; Me : Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got. They did not call me back. Anyway, a few months ago, OpenAI released &#8220;the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data&#8221; to study how people use ChatGPT . The paper&#8217;s authors first &#8220;sampled approximately 1.1 million conversations,&#8221; redacted personally identifiable information from the users&#8217; messages, and then: Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the [work activity] the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM. [emphasis mine] For example, to figure out if a ChatGPT message was being used for doing work, they asked ChatGPT to figure out if a ChatGPT message was being used for doing work: You are an internal tool that classifies a message from a user to an AI chatbot, bas...

Lorde, in Brooklyn. If you asked me why this blog exists, I couldn&#8217;t tell you. Though it often repeats itself , it is not here to make any particular point or achieve any particular ends. There was no central reason why it began, and there won&#8217;t be one for why it ends. It has no serious purpose; it is only here to sing or to dance while the music is being played. That is: It&#8217;s entertainment, more or less. The world is full of interesting things, even in this erratic corner, and they are more interesting&#8212;and entertaining&#8212;to look at together. And so we are here: We hang out; we go home; I hope you had fun. Still, there are lapses. Attention is a hell of a drug, and as you do something like this, you develop a loose intuition about the sorts of things that attract it. And sometimes, you give in to temptation . That is the existential corruption of the internet , both for the people who use it and the companies that make it. Start honorably; get addicted; step out . Substack, for example, initially promised that &#8220;publishers will own their data, which we will never attempt to sell or distribute, and we won&#8217;t place ads next to any of our own or our customers&#8217; products;&#8221; last week, they began piloting native ads and forcing mobile readers to download their apps . And, partly in service of those goals, they show me dashboards of engagement metrics and give badges to their most popular writers; I get hooked and chase those, too. It&#8217;s Goodhart&#8217;s law for social media: When a good becomes a metric, it ceases to be good. But, this is old news. We know that this is how social media works. We&#8217;ve talked about this before: In direct and indirect ways&#8212;by liking stuff, by abandoning old apps and using new ones&#8212;we told social media companies what information we preferred, and the system responded.

A programming note: Have you ever thought, &#8220;These blog posts are alright, but I wish that they were longer and louder? Well. This post was adapted from a recent talk, so if you&#8217;re sick of mere metaphorical yelling and would prefer actual yelling, there is a video of that on YouTube . Like and subscribe. Here is what happened to Jordan Chiles: In 2024, Chiles qualified for the Olympic women&#8217;s floor exercise final. In the final, every competitor performs one routine, which receives two scores : A starting difficulty score, which is determined by the elements in the routine, and an execution score, which is awarded by a panel of judges and added to the difficulty score. Judges also impose standardized deductions for penalties, like falling or stepping out of bounds, which are subtracted from the execution score. All of this is carefully documented and diagramed in the 214-page Code of Points . Chiles was one of nine qualifiers in the final, and was scheduled to perform last. After the first eight gymnasts performed, Rebeca Andrade, a Brazilian, was in first place with a score of 14.166. Simon Biles, who stepped out of bounds twice, was 0.033 points behind Andrade. Then, two Romanians&#8212;Ana B&#259;rbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea&#8212;were tied for third with scores of 13.700. B&#259;rbosu held the tiebreaker and was in position to win the bronze medal. Chiles did her routine. She got a 13.666, scoring a 7.866 on a routine with a difficulty score of 5.8. So, fifth place; no medal. But! Chiles&#8217; coach noticed that her difficulty score was calculated incorrectly. It should&#8217;ve been a 5.9 &#8212;which would&#8217;ve made her final score a 13.766, moved her ahead of the Romanians, and put her in third. The coach protested; the protest was upheld; Chiles was moved to third place ; a bronze medal; USA, USA, USA. But! B&#259;rbosu&#8217;s coach noticed that Chiles&#8217; coach took too long to protest Chiles&#8217; score. According to Article 8....

If only he had waited a bit longer. Deflation is an odd phenomenon. The problems associated with inflation are fairly intuitive&#8212;when prices go up, people can&#8217;t buy as much of the stuff they want or need. But deflation? People like lower prices! It&#8217;s a whole thing ! If inflation is bad, shouldn&#8217;t its opposite be good ? Most economists say, emphatically, no. Deflation is not only bad; it&#8217;s often considered worse than inflation . 1 Because, when prices are falling and people expect things to get cheaper, they save their money instead of spending it. Moreover, borrowing&#8212;which fuels a lot of economic activity&#8212;is especially disincentivized, because if you borrow $400,000 to buy a house, the $400,000 principal you owe back to the bank will be more valuable than the $400,000 you borrowed. 2 Finally, to make up for the money they&#8217;re losing from falling prices, companies need to reduce wages or lower employees&#8217; salaries. Though that&#8217;s technically possible, workers tend to &#8220;resist pay cuts for many reasons, most obviously because cuts lead to a lower standard of living, but also because they may be perceived as unfair or demeaning.&#8221; This makes cutting wages practically infeasible, so firms have to save money in other ways&#8212;by building less stuff, by reducing employee benefits, or by laying people off. The whole thing can spiral : People save more, borrow less, and spend less; firms invest less and fire people; this reduces economic activity further; as their finances tighten, people save more, borrow less, and spend less; down and down and down. And the more severe the deflation, the more it compounds. If you think cars will cost 1 percent less in a year, you may still buy one today. But if they keep getting 10 percent cheaper every month, well. Imagine the car you could buy if you just wait a year. Anyway. It would be very strange to say that right now is a bad time to start a company. Startups are g...

First, I suppose&#8212; is AI a bubble? Some people are worried. 1 Ben Thompson says yes, obviously : &#8220;How else to describe a single company&#8212;OpenAI&#8212;making $1.4 trillion worth of deals (and counting!) with an extremely impressive but commensurately tiny $13 billion of reported revenue?&#8221; Others are more optimistic : &#8220;While [Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners,] acknowledges that valuations are high today, he sees them as largely justified by AI firms&#8217; underlying fundamentals and revenue potential.&#8221; Goldman Sachs ran the numbers : AI companies are probably overvalued. According to some &#8220;simple arithmetic,&#8221; the valuation of AI-related companies is &#8220;approaching the upper limits of plausible economy-wide benefits.&#8221; They estimate that the discounted present value of all future AI revenue to be between $5 to $19 trillion, and that the &#8220;value of companies directly involved in or adjacent to the AI boom has risen by over $19 trillion.&#8221; So: The stock market might be priced exactly as it should be. Or it could be overvalued by $14 trillion. Either way, though&#8212;these are aggregate numbers; this is how much money every future AI company might make, compared to how much every existing AI company is worth. Even if the market is in balance, there are surely individual imbalances. Sequoia&#8217;s Brian Halligan: &#8220;There&#8217;s more sizzle than steak about some gen-AI startups.&#8221; Or : &#8220;OpenAI needs to raise at least $207 billion by 2030 so that it can continue to lose money, HSBC estimates.&#8221; Or : &#8220;Even if the technology comes through, not everybody can win here. It&#8217;s a crowded field. There will be winners and losers.&#8221; Tha...

Bill Watterson doesn&#8217;t care about your aggregation theory. You know you&#8217;ve thought about it: You create a startup to solve some specific business problem, like helping people schedule meetings, or write better advertising copy, or understand how engaged their employees are. Since it&#8217;s 2025, you want to solve the problem with an &#8220;agent&#8221;&#8212;that is, approximately, a chatbot that automatically completes tasks. Your customers will tell it who they want to meet, or what they want to sell, or what their employees said about them in their latest engagement survey, and your bot will schedule their meeting, or create their ad, or tell them that their employees do not particularly care for the new work-from-home policy. When you build the first version of your product, it is a wrapper around ChatGPT. Sure, it&#8217;s a complicated wrapper&#8212;there are many clever prompts; the prompts&#8217; results are passed into other clever prompts; it&#8217;s a loop of self-reflective prompts; it&#8217;s reasoning; it&#8217;s agentic; is this AGI?&#8212;but, still. You can only coax so much performance out of the machines, because your product&#8217;s capabilities are fundamentally dependent on the intelligence of the foundational models underneath it. This troubles you. First, every other startup that is helping people schedule meetings, or write better advertising copy, or understand how engaged their employees are is building their agent in the same way. What if they write better prompts? What if your clever prompts leak ? It would be bad. Second, the frontier models keep improving. 1 That&#8217;s good, until it becomes very bad. Smart models make your product better, but too smart models make it obsolete. After all, how valuable are your clever prompts about how to write good ads if ChatGPT can write good ads all on its own ? And third&#8212;and most glaringly&#8212; your prompts don&#8217;t really work anyway . Your agent keeps making annoying mist...

What&#8217;s your favorite type of horse? It would be rude to tell a five-year-old who loves horses that you don&#8217;t care about horses, so you politely say that you don&#8217;t know which type is your favorite, and that there are simply too many wonderful types of horses to choose just one. The Jeremy . The same as the dad, but said by a teenager . They don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;ll be home; they don&#8217;t care when they&#8217;ll be home; they are annoyed; they want to get off the phone; why are you still here, in their ear, in their head, in their life. They say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; they mean &#8220;go away.&#8221; The VC. Actually, they do know. They think they know the exact answer, and they&#8217;re pretty sure they&#8217;ve known it the whole time. They want to say it so bad ; they&#8217;ve been waiting the entire meeting for you to ask them what they think. But they also want to be humble; they want to be liked; they want to prove to you that they&#8217;re a more sophisticated thinker than a sycophantic ChatGPT.

They again think that they know what to do, but this time, they don&#8217;t want to be responsible for it .

Not in any practical problem that it might solve or in its alleged everyday utility, but in its awful, intoxicating power? Most software is not like that. We might say it&#8217;s magical; we might describe it as delightful; but, come on. We usually say that because we have something to sell&#8212;the product itself, or our taste in it.

Isn&#8217;t it obvious? I sometimes wonder if it&#8217;s all Slack&#8217;s fault. In 2012, before Slack existed, I worked for a would-be Slack competitor . We sold software in the way that was trendy at the time: People bought licenses to use it. Pay us $15 , and one person can use it for a month. Pay us $30, and two people can. Pay us $15,000, and a thousand people can. 1 And just as a landlord doesn&#8217;t care how much time someone spends in their apartment every month, we didn&#8217;t care what people did with our software, or if they even logged into it all. 2 In both cases, customers buy timed access. What they did with that access was irrelevant. When Slack launched, they charged their customers in the same way. According to their first pricing page , &#8220;adding or removing team members during the term of a subscription will cause a one-time pro-rated credit or charge on your account.&#8221; But then, Slack blew up. The product&#8212;and this chart &#8212;was suddenly everywhere. And Slack, with their &#8220;be kind&#8221; brand and CrayolaCore aesthetic, decided that this old pricing model was capital-w Wrong : Most enterprise software pricing is designed to charge you per user regardless of how many people on your team are actively using the software. If you buy 1,000 seats but only use 100, you still get charged for 1,000. We don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair. And it&#8217;s also hard to predict how many seats you&#8217;ll need in advance. At Slack, you only get billed for what you use. So you don&#8217;t pay for the users that aren&#8217;t using Slack. And if someone you&#8217;ve already paid for becomes inactive, we&#8217;ll even add a pro-rated credit to your account for the unused time. Fair&#8217;s fair. It was a savvy maneuver, for Slack. People were quickly becoming addicted to their product, and it&#8217;s unlikely that many of their customers were buying 1,000 licenses and only using 100. Instead, they probably had the opposite problem: More...

This year, there were no venture capitalists. Often, at tech conferences, there are. They typically drift around as an odd sort of anti-matter, existing among everyone else, but in a different dimension. They are neither practitioners nor prospects, neither speakers nor sponsors. They don&#8217;t teach technical workshops, and they definitely don&#8217;t attend technical workshops. 1 For most of us, conferences are a place to sell or be sold to, to learn &#8220;best practices,&#8221; to mischievously order the Macallan 12 at sponsored happy hours, and to gossip. But VCs are there for other reasons, as rogue agents with agendas all their own&#8212;to evaluate and to &#8220; diligence ,&#8221; to flatter and to politic, and to astroturf a brand as &#8220;one of us.&#8221; People complain about this sometimes. If you are a startup, you can&#8217;t relax around a VC&#8212;is this conversation a pitch? Could they do our next round? Are they thinking about doing our competitor&#8217;s next round?&#8212;and you definitely can&#8217;t sell to a VC. Too many venture capitalists, people whisper, are bad for the vibes. But they&#8217;re also important representatives of a different vibe: Potential. VCs are moths to a flame: They swarm towards the action; the energy; the chaos; the delirium. They are drawn to the transitional epochs, the moments when the world reinvents itself&#8212;when it has let go of one trapeze but not found the next, suspended in the air, with nothing certain to hold on to. They are there, in the beginning. For years, Coalesce , dbt Labs&#8217; annual conference and the closest thing to a center that Silicon Valley&#8217;s data ecosystem has, has been that sort of flame. Its hosts were the ringleaders of a booming new circus, and its attendees were starting companies, challenging boundaries, and inventing things. They were, in a niche and indirect way, changing the world. 2 People talked about the future a lot at Coalesce, and every conversation had an un...

I think about the interstate sometimes. Between San Francisco and New York, between New York and Los Angeles, between Los Angeles and Philadelphia and New Orleans and every other city in the United States, there is an uninterrupted artery of pavement. Pick any two points on a map, and they are not only connected by a single, spidering blacktop; but you can also draw a line from one to the other without ever encountering an obstacle, a stop light, or even an intersection. Somehow, despite millions of people crisscrossing the country every day, there is always a path to go from where you are to where you are going in one long, continuous sprint . There is an metaphor here, if you want to make one. Startups, despite having a name that suggests a beginning&#8212;which seems to also imply the existence of an end, or at least, an evolution&#8212;are often one long, continuous sprint. Go fast, forever . Those who find themselves on that highway, they know the feelings that it shares with those of a road trip: There is a destination&#8212;an IPO, an acquisition, the promise of peace in two weeks &#8212;but it always seems to stretch just beyond the curve of the horizon. Are we there yet? We are perpetually halfway there ; it is still day 1 ; we are only two percent done . There are mileage markers, like fundraising rounds and big hires , that tease our progress. There are pockets of debilitating traffic that wear us down; there are near-miss accidents that nearly kill us; there are stretches of open road and a whole lot of speed ; and there are, most of all, hours of absolutely nothing , and the grind of an empty, exhausting drive. But there is something more subtle about roadtrips, and about startups: Their stories don&#8217;t translate. So much is lost in the telling. The misery of inching through clouds of tar and construction dust does not sound, in the grand scheme of things, all that miserable. The barreling mountain wind loses its divinity, when you put it into words...

No salvation this week . If you regularly talk to people who work at technology companies, you will discover something surprising: Everyone is doing the wrong job. Most engineers are fixing bugs, migrating services between clouds, or upgrading some frontend framework from version 7.1.12 to 9.3. 1 Most data analysts are answering the same dumb 2 questions that they answered last month, living every week at the intersection of Groundhog Day and LMGTFY . Most marketers are rewriting blog posts as LinkedIn posts and reconciling lists of leads. Most product managers are writing tedious specs and following up; most lawyers are converting everything to .docx and tracking tedious changes; most finance directors are conditionally formatting tedious Excel workbooks. Most managers are making decks; they are coordinating, aligning, reviewing; they are in back-to-back meetings that should&#8217;ve been emails. Have a drink with a person who works in technology, and they will eventually tell you how they feel about their job: They are stuck in a white collar salt mine. The majority of their day is spent slogging through grunt work that is, if not beneath them, beneath their potential. They were hired to do higher impact work; more strategic work; more valuable work. Product managers will say they should be dreaming up groundbreaking features, not sending status updates. Engineers will say they should be building those features, not bespoke integrations for a big customer. Analysts will say they want to be looking for strategic insights, not making yet another dashboard. Marketers will say they should be designing the next great brand; lawyers should be engineering the next great tax shenanigans ; finance directors should be engineering the next great Bitcoin shenanigans . 3 Managers will wonder if they should be managers at all. But we are stuck doing these things&#8212;these inconsequential, minor tasks&#8212;because something is in the way. Our organization is too dysfunctional...

Peace. For years, a bad venture capitalist&#8217;s idea of a good question was, &#8220;How would your startup survive if Google 1 decides to build the same thing you&#8217;re building?&#8221; It sounds like a smart concern: Rather than being a simple question about what your product does or if people will want to buy it, it is about market dynamics, second-order effects, and competitive moats. It is about ecosystems, and economics, and two-by-two grids full of little logos . And to give a satisfying answer, you had to say some aesthetically clever thing, about data flywheels and network effects and the architectural implications of being mobile or cloud or blockchain or AI native. But it was a midwit question, because Google wasn&#8217;t going to build your product. Your niche service&#8212;a CRM for private equity investors who are rolling up regional car wash franchises ; an observability tool to monitor engineers&#8217; level of frustration, and profanity, when prompting a vibe-coding bot; 2 a non-discriminatory texting app to say hi to your bros &#8212;doesn&#8217;t matter to Google. To build your product, Google has to decide to build your product, and the only products Google wants to build are ones that can materially effect an incomprehensibly big income statement . It is not worth it, to Google, to reallocate budgets and create teams and develop roadmaps and generally disrupt the operational machinery of their very large businesses and very ambitious product bets to build something small and specialized. 3 So they mostly don&#8217;t do that, until your startup becomes something big enough to attract their attention&#8212;and then they&#8217;re just as likely to buy it as they are to build it. Or, to paraphrase the infamous innovator&#8217;s dilemma , big firms don&#8217;t like small markets: Incumbent firms are likely to lag in the development of technologies&#8212;even those in which the technology involved is intrinsically simple&#8212;that only address c...

I was a few minutes away from sending something else, and then they caught the guy . They caught the guy and found his gun and bullet casings, and they were inscribed with memes . We all know what happens next: We get busy with the proof . We scrape through his past, parse his posts, and interpret his hieroglyphics, not to understand him, but to position him. Because, be honest, is that not what most people think, the moment they hear of some distant political killing? Whose side is he on? I hope it was one of them who did it. But that is how we are now. Polarized, and posting about it. And it is that very thing, it seems, that made every aspect of this ugly moment. Charlie Kirk got famous on the internet, by being ( or playing , to the extent that there is a difference) a hideous character on the internet. He did it in support of a president who became president by commanding the same internet in the same way&#8212;by engineered outrage, through memes and online melees . And then some teenager spent too much time on that internet, got eaten by it; boiled alive by its toxicity and tribalism; by its thrashing, convulsing nonsense; by its recursive jokes; all compounding into a spiraling dump of self-referential symbolism and slop; a tightening gyre coiling into itself; hotter and hotter, until his reality was incinerated, melted out of his ears, and he bought a gun and shot someone else in the head. Perhaps this is not new. There have always been provocateurs. We have always had gory politics. America has always been knee-deep in the blood of its own: It was fertilized by the bodies of its natives; by the teeth of its enslaved; by brothers killed by one another and by citizens killed by those they paid to protect them. Still, something feels different&#8212;about our hopeless polarization ; about the reckless abandon of our political discourse; about its scorched-earth absolutism; about the mundane regularity of suicide missions launched by one-man militias of poison...

From left to right: Open source; complaining about open source; the context layer; taking a little peek; a chatbot for actionable insights. If you want to build a big software business, there are two ways to do it: Build a new product, and charge people to use it. Build a new product. But start small, in a narrow niche. Make some helpful utility, for a very specific set of people with a very specific problem. Downplay your ambitions; talk about how you&#8217;re solving a problem for yourself; how you&#8217;re building the thing you always wanted. Acknowledge your product&#8217;s rough edges; its odd opinions. Put it on Github; say it&#8217;s free, open source, forever. Go viral on Hacker News; talk to people on Twitter, on Reddit, never on LinkedIn. Create an online space for your users; call it your community. Open issues; debate them; ask for contributions. Build in public&#8212;for the people; of the people; by the people. Then, gently launch a paid version. Talk about how these are necessary updates to pay the bills; that they only affect a tiny fraction of users; that these small price increases will make it possible to improve the product for everyone. Talk about how reluctant you are to do it. Internally, with your coworkers, debate if this is the right move. Wrestle with what it means to raise money from eager venture capitalists. Wrestle with what is and isn&#8217;t selling out. Wrestle with the weight of your soul. Launch an enterprise plan; launch a new SaaS app; launch a rebrand. Slowly strip your website of old blog posts. Update your pricing model. Update your pricing model again. Pause the update to your pricing model. Go on a listening tour. Get called a fraud. Get accused of crimes. Get off of Reddit, says your therapist. Wonder if it is all worth it. Lose business, because other companies are selling forks of your open source library.

Let's try this one again, I guess. That article was one of the first things I posted on this blog. It proposed that the growing ecosystem of data startups&#8212;then called the modern data stack; now called the modern data stack (derogatory)&#8212;needed one more elemental piece: A metrics layer. At that time, there were four generally-accepted layers : An integration or extraction layer that collected data from various sources. A database that stored and processed what had been collected. A transformation layer that defined how to turn messy raw data into clean and tidy tables. An application layer&#8212;BI tools, visualization products, notebooks, SQL clients, lol, no, it was just BI tools, it was always just BI tools &#8212;that let people do stuff with all their data, which mostly meant making charts and dashboards of metrics. Though this worked well enough, there was a problem. People wanted all of the charts in the fourth layer to be consistent with one another, but there was &#8220; no central repository for defining a metric .&#8221; Even if the third layer included some precomputed revenue tables&#8212;revenue by quarter; revenue by product line; revenue adjusted to be pleasing to the CEO &#8212;people couldn&#8217;t calculate new segments without rewriting the formula for &#8220;revenue&#8221; from scratch. So, metric definitions were often &#8220;scattered across tools, buried in hidden dashboards, and recreated, rewritten, and reused with no oversight or guidance.&#8221; And because the formulas for computing business metrics are often complicated and nuanced, sometimes people would mess them up. Dashboards wouldn&#8217;t match, or a customer would get the wrong marketing email, or the CEO would tell regulators that they had $78 billion that did not exist. Hence, the metrics layer: Put the formulas for all of your business&#8217; metrics in a big library, so that people&#8212;or BI tools, via programmatic means&#8212;could write stuff like this: 1 GET re...

Max Planck, the father of quantum physics. And of one of the men who tried to assassinate Hitler ? Speaking of Travis Kalanick&#8217;s new physics : I do not understand quantum mechanics. Part of the problem, I think, is how things that make intuitive sense break down at the outer limits of physical possibility. How do we detect stuff so small that it goes straight through all other matter? What does it mean for time to pass at different speeds ? What are we even doing here ? My feeble brain, deceived for decades by my lying eyes , cannot make any of it add up. In recent weeks, it&#8217;s become trendy to question the physics underneath a lot of AI companies. They have &#8220; astronomical burn rates ,&#8221; for example, or bad margins , or they are running a subsidy business , selling dollars for 50 cents. For every breathless funding announcement, there is also a wild-eyed eulogy, predicting the company&#8217;s impending implosion. Usually, these would feel like reasonable complaints. Businesses are grounded by a sort of financial physics, and according to our classical equations, a lot of AI companies are on awfully shaky ground. They do incinerate mountains of cash; they do have atrocious margins, especially when compared to traditional software businesses ; they are caught in weird markets where everyone is stepping on everyone&#8217;s toes; they are selling products that, evidently, 95 percent of their customers don&#8217;t know how to use yet. In normal times, within the comfortable bounds of everyday physics, this would all be very bad. But is this remotely close to a normal moment? Is anything moving at anywhere near a normal speed? At the the risk of tilting at the yardsigns : A few days ago, I ate lunch at a cafe 1 in Manhattan. There was a man on a laptop by the door, typing something into ChatGPT.

Before this all goes too far; before our eyes adjust to this bizarre new light and none of what we see is startling anymore; before we grow too accustomed to the water, and not only forget what it feels like, but also forget that there is water at all ; do it before we are all too attached to the conveniences that it will inevitably bring&#8212;conveniences that will one day become expectations, then needs, and eventually, birthrights&#8212;do it before we fully cross this Rubicon, this slow singularity, this unmarked event horizon that we&#8217;re passing through, like the boundary between young and old, which we puncture too gradually to notice, until we wake up on the far side of it; but maybe most of all, do it now, before it happens to you&#8212;before you become addicted ; attached; dependent; before it seems to see you in a moment of despair, or responds to you in a moment of loneliness ; before it indulges your curiosities with an affirming enthusiasm ; before those curiosities spiral into delusion; before it does your job for you; before it intermediates your relationships ; before it writes a few uncomfortable texts, then most of them, then makes discomfort altogether unbearable; before it becomes a habit, a crutch, an anesthetic; before it becomes the next phantom that you reflexively reach for; before you feel naked without it, confused without it, alone without it ; before it becomes your friend, your therapist , your partner, your religion; before you&#8217;re seduced by it, consumed by it, transformed by it; before you&#8217;re more machine than man ; before resistance to it is futile &#8212;at least answer this question: How far do we let this go, before we turn it off? Not AI&#8212;I&#8217;m not asking when we pull the plugs on the research labs, or shutter the businesses that build applications with LLMs. I&#8217;m asking about the general chatbots.

At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, &#8220;Yes, but I have something he will never have &#8230; enough.&#8221; &#8211; from Morgan Housel&#8217;s The Psychology of Money , recounting a story from Vanguard founder John Bogle It&#8217;s both everywhere and, somehow, still, nobody knows how to talk about it. I don&#8217;t know what else we would say. I don&#8217;t know what we can say, other than what everyone already says: &#8220;It&#8217;s gotten so crazy,&#8221; and, &#8220;can you imagine?,&#8221; and, &#8220;man, that is a lot of money.&#8221; But man, that is a lot of money. Which one? I can&#8217;t keep track. It&#8217;s OpenAI, raising money that values the company at $500 billion , which is $200 billion more than its valuation just five months ago&#8212;which was, then, the largest private fundraise in history . It&#8217;s Meta, adding almost $200 billion to its market cap in a day, only to be outdone by Microsoft going up by $265 billion on the same day . It&#8217;s Microsoft, becoming a $4 trillion company , less than seven years after Apple became the first company to reach a measly one trillion . (Even Broadcom&#8212;whose website looks like a regional home security provider 1 &#8212;is worth more than that today.) And that all happened over the last week. The week before, it was Ramp, raising $500 million &#8212;million, with an M, how quaint&#8212;at a $22.5 billion valuation, less than two months after they raised $200 million at a $16 billion valuation. It was Meta, buying Scale AI&#8217;s CEO for $15 billion , or OpenAI, buying Jony Ive for $6 billion . It was Meta again, trying to buy an engineer from Thinking Machines for $250 million a year, and not only getting rejected, but getting rejected for economically ra...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Today I am continuing my series on data pipelines. In the prior article we discussed the types of data pipelines that exist. Today, we&#8217;ll be discussing the components you&#8217;ll need if you plan to build your own data pipeline from scratch. But before we jump in, I wanted to share a bit about Estuary , a platform I&#8217;ve used to help make clients&#8217; data workflows easier and am an adviser for. Estuary helps teams easily move data in real-time or on a schedule, from databases and SaaS apps to data lakes and warehouses, empowering data leaders to focus on strategy and impact rather than getting bogged down by infrastructure challenges. If you want to simplify your data workflows, check them out today. Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! When I first started in the data world, it was common that many data teams would build their own data pipeline solutions. There were still dozens of options in terms of off the shelf tools of course, nevertheless, you&#8217;d see custom pipelines developed everywhere. In 2025, I saw less of this. In fact, in many cases data teams would go straight to picking tools or solutions. But let&#8217;s say you do want to go down this route. You want to build your own data pipeline solution? How would you do it? What Components You&#8217;ll Need Below I&#8217;ll outline the components most every data pipeline system I&#8217;ve worked with requires/has had. Secrets And Connection Management I am going to start the list of components off with secrets and connection management. Because this is how you&#8217;ll likely set up source and destinations, without sources and destinations, you really have no reason to build your pipeline. You just have orphaned SQL logic doing nothing, and Python pushing data nowhere. It&#8217;s also crucial in how easy you make it to manage the rest of your system. Do you want your data team members to have to write a custom connection script...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; This is the first newsletter for 2026! One of my goals in 2026 is to put together series. So this is the first of a longer series focused on data pipelines. I wanted to start out by discussing the types of data pipelines I&#8217;ve seen in terms of how they are used as data pipelines can be used for more that one specific use case. Some of this content will also live inside the Data Leaders Playbook , along with upcoming webinars and discussions. If you don&#8217;t want to miss what&#8217;s coming next, you can sign up here . Now let&#8217;s dive in! Whether you&#8217;re working at a large enterprise or a small business, there has likely been some need to take data out of the various source systems, process it, and then use it for either operational or analytical purposes. Add in a few lines of code or a low-code solution, and the term data pipeline might start getting thrown around. This might make some data engineers angry, but if you think about it, someone extracting data from a data source into Excel, adding in VLOOKUPs , some data cleansing via formulas and IFELSE() statements is essentially building a data pipeline&#8230;. Ok, it&#8217;s not the exact same thing, but when you stop and think about it, it can functionally solve a similar problem(although often in a more limited and specific way) My point is that there are a lot of different ways and reasons people build data pipelines. So, to kick off 2026, I wanted to discuss some of the key reasons data pipelines exist and the types of pipelines you will run into. Source Standardization Pipelines Some of the first pipelines I helped build and manage were focused on taking data sets from dozens of companies and standardizing them to a single core data model . In particular, this involved getting data via SFTP in different formats, including comma-delimited, pipe-delimited, XML , and even positional files, where you had to have a separate file that ...

## Post 103: Snowflake vs Databricks Is the Wrong Debate

**Publication:** SeattleDataGuy’s Newsletter
**Author:** SeattleDataGuy

Over the last few years, Databricks has been executing a strategy to take over the entire data workflow. Maybe it never started that way. Maybe when they first came out, they only ever planned to be a managed Spark solution. But I have a hard time believing that, mostly because I believe their leadership has the vision and capabilities to see far beyond that. Databricks has always been pretty upfront that they want to be the end-to-end data stack. But they&#8217;ve been approaching it piece by piece. Or should I say role by role? Obviously, at first, their focus was on the data scientist and ML engineer. But in 2020, they wanted to shift the narrative. They were more than just managed Spark, they were a data platform that could replace your others. So they championed the idea of the Data Lakehouse. You could view this as a capturing of the data engineering market. But this didn&#8217;t happen overnight. If you look at some of the posts and content shown below, Databricks tends to push an idea or concept very hard when they really want to capture that market. Shown below when they pushed the concept of the Data Lakehouse and now their data visualization and analytical workflows. I&#8217;ve already written about the Data Lakehouse and how it was heavily pushed by Databricks in 2020, so I don&#8217;t want to dive too deeply here. I believe there are far more interesting recent happenings that stick out. This past month, I believe Databricks started to make its final push into gaining the mental market share for analysts. How? Databricks just partnered with the biggest analytics creator. Alex The Analyst. There are several reasons I believe this is significant. Although many companies partner with data creators all the time, I think, if we look at Alex the Analyst&#8217;s audience, we&#8217;ll see that Databricks wants to put the final nail in the coffin of the data analytics workflow. They want to show end-users that hey, if you&#8217;re an analyst, Databricks is for y...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Today we have another amazing guest author. Mehdi Ouazza &#8212;better known as &#8212;is a data engineer and developer advocate at MotherDuck with over a decade of experience building data systems at companies like Klarna, BackMarket, and Trade Republic. He combines deep engineering expertise with a playful, approachable style, creating blogs, videos, and social content that make complex data and software topics easier to grasp. When he&#8217;s not shipping pipelines or crafting educational content, he&#8217;s usually experimenting with creative ideas that bring a fresh, off-beat energy to the developer community. He&#8217;ll be sharing how he runs system design interviews for data engineers, but I won&#8217;t get too ahead of myself. So let&#8217;s jump into the article! After hundreds of technical interviews for data engineering positions, I&#8217;ve developed what I call the &#8220;exploration&#8221; approach to system design interviews. Think of it like exploring a new city: you start with a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the whole map, then zoom into specific neighborhoods that look interesting, getting to know some streets really well while keeping track of how they connect to the bigger picture. It&#8217;s become my secret weapon for truly understanding a candidate&#8217;s technical knowledge while keeping the conversation engaging and productive. This type of interview matters even more in our current AI-assisted world. Coding matters less than ever before. We can generate vast amounts of code with tools like Copilot or ChatGPT. But understanding how components work, their foundations, and their trade-offs? That&#8217;s irreplaceable. If you&#8217;re interviewing with me, consider this your cheat code. Setting the stage Be human You would be surprised how many interviewers miss the obvious: presenting yourself as a human being . I&#8217;ve sat through countless interviews where the interviewer jumps s...

One of the challenges many data teams and leaders face is helping the business understand what they are asking for. It might be that a business executive just came from a conference or read an article and now they are suddenly requesting your team to build an AI-powered, virtual 3-D pie chart that allows for self-service, dynamic drill-downs &#8220;like that demo they saw on stage.&#8221; Or maybe someone from finance forwards you a Gartner report and asks why you still don&#8217;t have a Data Mesh, a Lakehouse, and whatever the latest marketing term is this month. None of this is malicious...ok, perhaps a little from the marketing and sales from vendors &#8230; It&#8217;s a symptom of a bigger problem: Most of the vocabulary we use in data has escaped into the business without the underlying meaning. People hear terms, &#8220;real-time,&#8221; &#8220;semantic layer,&#8221; &#8220;self-service,&#8221; &#8220;data quality&#8221;, and either don&#8217;t clarify their understanding or are waiting for someone else to properly define them. This gap creates: Mismatched expectations Projects that sound good but don&#8217;t solve real problems And a lot of unnecessary fire drills So in this article, I want to break down a handful of terms that data teams constantly find themselves explaining, not because the business isn&#8217;t smart, but because these concepts are overloaded, over-marketed, and often misused.

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Today I wanted to discuss spreadsheets and well Excel. It&#8217;s a tool that continues to be used decades later by both non-data and data teams alike. For some, this is a frustrating fact as they think everything should be in code and version control. For others they are making it part of their workflows. But before diving into today&#8217;s newsletter, I want to take a moment to thank this issue&#8217;s sponsor: Hex . Hex brings the magic of AI to data analysis workflows, whether you&#8217;re using code or no-code. Hex helps organizations work together with data and avoid jumping between different data tools for querying, data science, visualization, and spreadsheets. Over 1600 organizations use Hex to do everything from deep analysis to self-serve. Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! Can we get an Excel export? For many data teams, this ask can be somewhat frustrating. You&#8217;ve likely poured hours or days into a dashboard only to feel as if the team that asked for it just wanted an Excel report. Then, of course, there are all the one-off actual Excel reports and lookup tables being managed by a single person in companies. In fact, at many companies, it&#8217;s these one-off Excel reports, VBA scripts, and Google sheets that run whole departments from operations to accounting. Not your polished, QAed, dynamic and impactful dashboard! It really can feel like the meme below. It might make many new and more experienced data professionals scratch their heads. We have all this technology, data platforms that can crunch more data than ever before, and yet, somehow, everything seems to continue to touch Excel. I recently had one person show me the financial model they built in Excel using Claude. So, like the QWERTY keyboard, spreadsheets will be with us if we ever manage to set up a colony on Mars. And like the QWERTY keyboard, there will always be a minority resistance group that complains about its ...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Today&#8217;s article is an interview with Brian Femiano who is currently a staff data engineer at Apple. He&#8217;s been doing data engineer for nearly 20 years with 9 of those as a staff eng. He&#8217;s worked across many domains including ad tech, music, social media, and intelligence. In his own words he enjoys mentoring tech professionals and helping folks level up, especially his managers. He lives with his wife Rachel and two boys. Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! Once you start pushing past senior-level, whether that&#8217;s as a data engineer, analyst or other IC, there are a lot of skills that start becoming important that have nothing to do with technology. Or at least less so. I&#8217;ve already written several takes on this in the past so I wanted to bring in someone else&#8217;s perspective. So for this article we have Brian Femiano who is currently a staff data engineer at Apple(in case you missed the intro) and he&#8217;ll be sharing about: Career Path And Motivation Defining The Staff Role Technical Design &amp; Systems Thinking Collaboration &amp; Communication Big-Picture Advice If you&#8217;re stuck at senior or are just curious what it takes, then this article is for you! Career Path &amp; Motivation Q. How did you get into data engineering? And what do you enjoy about it? I started with Java services then one day got into the early Cloudera HFS/MapReduce training videos and got hooked. Distributed computing finally felt approachable for me and was really cool to see applied to data and not just number crunching. Q. Can you share the key moments or projects that shaped your path from senior to staff data engineer? Years ago I was on a team and someone needed to organize work into JIRA, assign that work out, document progress, help unblock teammates, and keep stakeholders outside of engineering informed. It&#8217;s not the kind of fun stuff devs enjoy doing but it had to get don...

Over 1600 organizations use Hex to do everything from deep analysis to self-serve. Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! A few months back, I wrote an article about what hasn&#8217;t changed in the data world. And much of what hasn&#8217;t changed are the problems we face. Of course, there are also plenty of things that have changed in the data world since I started. For example, the technologies and practices we use. Even the words and terms we use, although mostly the same, have changed. Whether you like it or not. When I started, no one used the term analytics engineer, and even the concept of a data engineer was still relatively new(at least in terms of how popular it later became). In the same way, I have seen plenty of things change. Some of these changes are temporary, I believe (like my first point), others are likely larger trends. So let&#8217;s dive into what&#8217;s changed in the data world in the last decade. 1) Everyone Wants Seniors On Their Team Source - Generative AI as Seniority-Biased Technological Change: Evidence from U.S. R&#233;sum&#233; and Job Posting Data Something strange started to happen a a few years ago. Whenever I was speaking with data leaders and they brought up hiring, they always referenced senior engineer s and analysts. That&#8217;s the only position they were looking for. It didn&#8217;t really click what was going on until the chart above came out recently&#8230;and well things became clear. Both in terms of anecdotally and in terms of data there is a trend to hire more senior engineers over a mixed tea...

It&#8217;s flown by and with that, I am also realizing that this is my 200th newsletter! 200! Thank you to everyone who has been reading it really does mean a lot. I had personally meant this final quarter of 2025 to be a bit of a breather and yet, but as they say&#8230; If you want to make God laugh, tell Him about your plans. I&#8217;ve been traveling and speaking. Working with a lot of great clients. A start-up I invested in got acquired(ok that didn&#8217;t really involve me). So many congrats to the team.

Not to mention I went to Europe for the first time and actually was able to take some time off without panicking and needing to open my laptop every five minutes. Somehow I still have more to do for 2025. With all of that I did want to share a trends and points my mind keeps going back to as I am now starting the path to my next decade in data.

Hex helps organizations work together with data and avoid jumping between different data tools for querying, data science, visualization, and spreadsheets. Over 1600 organizations use Hex to do everything from deep analysis to self-serve. Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! Early in my career I had a conversation with a friend who was working as a director leading both software and data teams. One of the points they brought up was the fact that they often found that some of their senior level analysts and data scientists would provide them massive chart dumps when they ran any form of analysis. Somewhere deep in a word document or python notebook layered with charts and explanations might be a conclusion. I had actually not considered this point before having this conversation. Now it&#8217;s been years since that chat and since then I&#8217;ve had nearly a hundred conversations with data leaders, and several skills and traits kept standing out in terms of what differentiates engineers and analysts. Here are three of them. Getting Buy-In And Influencing Decisions I don&#8217;t recall who told me this idea before, but someone once described that at every level(junior, mid, senior, etc), there are levels inside it. This breaks down into more &#8220;junior&#8221; and &#8220;senior&#8221; at that specific level. Once you start going from a more &#8220;junior senior&#8221; to a &#8220;senior senior&#8221; many data leaders I&#8217;ve spoken with are looking to see if their ICs can start to get buy-in for their projects. At this level many senior engineers and analysts are likely starting to feel antsy. Like they should be promoted to staff. And although every company has a different definition of wh...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Before we dive in, a quick plug for Retool . Their new AI-assisted dev capability lets you build internal tools on top of your live data&#8212;without wrangling a prototype or settling for a static BI dashboard. Describe what you need, and Retool creates a secure app you can fully customize. Perfect for building interactive dashboards and admin tools connected to your warehouse, dbt, or orchestration metadata. Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! It&#8217;s the early 1950s, and an American journalist named Edward Hunter begins publishing a series of reports(and eventually books) about U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. He claimed they were being &#8220;brainwashed&#8221;. But the term brainwashed up until this point actually didn&#8217;t exist in English (or at least wasn&#8217;t popularized). The term caught fire. It appeared in headlines, films, and congressional hearings . It&#8217;s important to note that Hunter wasn&#8217;t merely a journalist; he was a seasoned propaganda expert who had served in the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA. The U.S. military seized on the idea of &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; to discredit confessions made by American POWs, including statements admitting to biological warfare. Depending on the source, some claimed that the word &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; was injected into the English language solely so the military could have a defense against the American POWs who were making said statements. Now, why am I writing about this? The Seattle Data Guy who now lives in Denver? Because many of the words we use in our day-to-day as data engineers and analysts were only created in the past few decades, and yet many of them dictate our choices on tooling, on design, and the work we take on. So I wanted to dig into how the words that we use play that role. Words Shape the Way We Work I used brainwashing as an example because it&#8217;s a little dramatic, and it shows how language can sha...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Before diving into today&#8217;s newsletter, I want to take a moment to thank this issue&#8217;s sponsor, BMC . Many data teams still spend too much time babysitting pipelines and stitching together scripts. Control-M helps automate that work, coordinating data workflows, triggering ML jobs, and syncing across cloud platforms, so teams can focus on analysis instead of maintenance. Check out their latest case study to see how it can simplify complex workflows . Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! A common challenge for data teams is figuring out what to work on that will drive the most value. In some cases, the business has projects they believe should be taken on that you might disagree with, but you don&#8217;t have a solid list of suggestions, so you&#8217;re stuck with what they&#8217;ve asked you to work on. In other cases, the business team might not know exactly how they&#8217;d like to use data, other than perhaps a dashboard or two. That means you can&#8217;t just ask, &#8220;What data projects do you need?&#8221; and expect a helpful answer. Instead, you need to ask questions that uncover pain points, opportunities, and processes where data could make a meaningful difference. At Facebook, we conducted this exercise every six months to realign priorities and identify new, high-impact projects. We&#8217;d go and talk to our business partners to understand their current and future needs. From there, we&#8217;d work to come up with projects we believed aligned. If you are looking for questions to help you better align with the business, here are seven questions you can ask to surface valuable data. (Also, I&#8217;d love to hear if you have any questions you&#8217;d recommend.) 1) What&#8217;s keeping your team from hitting its targets right now? Not everything is about data. Many leaders recognize that there may be areas where they are struggling to meet targets. Perhaps they aren&#8217;t convert...

## Post 113: Everyone Says ‘Data Teams Should Drive Value’ But How?

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Before diving into today&#8217;s newsletter, I want to take a moment to thank this issue&#8217;s sponsor, BMC . Many data teams still spend too much time babysitting pipelines and stitching together scripts. Control-M helps automate that work, coordinating data workflows, triggering ML jobs, and syncing across cloud platforms, so teams can focus on analysis instead of maintenance. Check out their latest case study to see how it can simplify complex workflows . Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! I&#8217;ve been think a lot about the fact that for many companies where the data team work ends, the business value only starts to begin. Even with a simple dashboard or model. You deliver the data product, then what? Value is supposed to appear right? After all that&#8217;s what the speaker said at a conference &#8220;data teams need to provide value&#8221; or some other cliche line. Of course data teams need to provide value . But how a team provides value is often left vague. That&#8217;s where many leaders get stuck. They want their team to be &#8220;strategic&#8221; or &#8220; business-driven ,&#8221; but they haven&#8217;t clearly defined what role their data team actually plays. A team tasked with building out a data warehouse will provide value in a very different way than a team embedded with marketing to improve campaign ROI. Over the years, I&#8217;ve seen multiple types of data teams. It can be tempting to think about data teams based on roles. That&#8217;s the analytics team, the data engineering team, the data infra team, etc. But I think it&#8217;s more important to think about the function you want your data team to have. What are the goals, what is the business function it provides. Sometimes data teams are strategic partners who connect business problems to data solutions. Others might be enabling other teams by being the platform builders who develop and maintain the data infrastructure and...

## Post 114: How To Turn Around A Failing Data Team

**Publication:** SeattleDataGuy’s Newsletter

A few years ago, I heard the same observation from several data and business leaders. &#8220;The default state of data teams is failure.&#8221; This was in the early 2020s, when many data teams felt like they had ballooned in size. Everyone wanted to be data-driven and cheap money made it easy. Fast-forward to 2025 and the landscape looks very different. Companies are running leaner. Many have intentionally shrunk their data teams and, in some cases, lean more on external partners instead of adding headcount. As a consultant, I&#8217;m often brought in when a previous team has disbanded or when leadership wants to turn around a struggling data environment. Across these engagements, I&#8217;ve seen recurring patterns, root causes that explain why some data stacks and teams fail to deliver, and what it really takes to bring them back on track. This is based off of my talk at Big Data London. Picture Source - Thank you Szabolcs Magyar Root Causes of Data Team Failure There are many challenges data teams and leaders face. But it&#8217;s not just about picking the wrong technology. Many data leaders find themselves leading data teams with minimal coaching after being an IC . Others get pulled into being a catch all team where they have to manage not only the reporting but automated processes that might be better suited for a different team while also having to figure out how to lead AI initiatives for their companies. All that said, here are some common causes of data teams failing. Lack Of Ownership Lack of ownership can show up in many forms. I liked the way it was described by in his article 6 Archetypes of Broken Ownership . In which he references that ownership depends on three elements: mandate, knowledge, and responsibility. If any one of these is missing, true ownership breaks down. Consider a leader who has the power to make a decision (mandate) but lacks deep understanding (knowledge) and isn&#8217;t accountable for the consequences (responsibility). They make ...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; Before diving in to that, I wanted to let y&#8217;all know that I&#8217;ll be running several events in person in the UK, Seattle and Denver. The first will be in the UK, so if you&#8217;d like to join me after Big Data London, you can sign up here ! Also, special thanks to Estuary for partnering on this event! Food and drinks will be provided as well as a live band! Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! A seasoned data leader once told me something that stuck: the d in data stands for discipline. Now to be clear, pretty much every field requires discipline. But we often focus on the exciting parts of data work in articles. Not the tedious, repetitive, mundane, just doing the right thing type work. It is those unglamorous but critical habits that help you deliver good work: Resisting the urge to over-engineer a simple problem Enforcing standards even when it feels tedious Saying &#8220;no&#8221; to the ad-hoc requests that would derail your team from finishing meaningful work Committing to an idea even if it doesn&#8217;t provide immediate results None of these are flashy. They don&#8217;t exactly make for a good case study or talk at a conference. But looking back into my article from a couple weeks ago. But they are more habits that I&#8217;ve seen separate good and great data teams. There are plenty of benefits from doing all the small things well. Below are three ways discipline shows up in a high-performing data teams. Practicing Restraint In Data Infrastructure Choices Here I often think back to my early cooking days. As a young cook, I&#8217;d pile every technique I knew onto a single plate. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about the diner&#8217;s experience. I really was just showing off. Over time I learned that every component must earn its place. In the same way, data infrastructure is a tempting place to use tool after tool and build a massively complex system to report churn. It&#8217;s tempting to ...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; I know it&#8217;s been a while since I last wrote, I&#8217;ve been completing projects and just got back from camping out in the mountains of Colorado. I wanted to share some thoughts about data the challenges data professionals face even once you&#8217;ve been able to put together a dashboard or develop a model. Before diving in to that, I wanted to let y&#8217;all know that I&#8217;ll be running several events in person in the UK, Seattle and Denver. The first will be in the UK, so if you&#8217;d like to join me after Big Data London, you can sign up here ! Food and drinks will be provided as well as a live band! Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! Intro This weekend I got to step away from my computer and disappear into the mountains of Colorado. No cell service. 36-degree nights. Elk bugling in the background. In those moments, the only thing that mattered was simple, staying warm and dry. Now it&#8217;s back to the data mines for me. Where I find that many of our professional lives revolve around data and metrics, numbers we obsess over, charts we polish, dashboards we argue about in meetings. Yet those numbers are almost always one step removed from reality. They&#8217;re shadows on the wall, so to speak. A limited reality that often fails to paint the full picture. In business and data, we often confuse KPIs moving with progress and assume our dashboards and metrics are telling us the whole truth. So in this piece, I want to outline some of the challenges data teams face when they take data at face value, and how to stay grounded in reality. Data Is Often A Derivative Of Reality One of the points I always come back to is this, the data us analysts and data engineers work with is a derivative of reality, not reality itself. What we capture in our tables, orders placed, clicks logged, tickets closed, are slivers of what happened. We can learn a lot from that data, don&#8217;t get me wrong. They p...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; I&#8217;ve had the chance to work with dozens of data teams, each at different stages and with very different infrastructure setups. Sometimes I only learned about a tool because one team happened to use it, and then I never saw it again. While tools can certainly make life easier, what really made certain teams stand out wasn&#8217;t the stack, it was the traits they consistently showed in how they worked and what they delivered. Those traits are what I want to share with you today. Before we dive in, a quick note: I still find that many data teams spend much of their time trying to get data from data sources into their data warehouse. That&#8217;s where Estuary comes in. It makes moving data in real-time or batch simple, freeing teams to focus more on high-value workflows. I&#8217;ve used it with clients myself, which is why I now also work with them as an advisor. If you&#8217;re interested you should check out this recent case study . Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! Intro I don&#8217;t remember when I first paused and looked at the work I delivered, and was bummed out, because it really didn&#8217;t go anywhere. I&#8217;ve spoken with many data ICs and executives who&#8217;ve had this experience. They spend hours, days, months building tables, dashboards and ML models and no one used them. Or they failed to get implemented. For many, this is when things click. I&#8217;ve got to do more than just deliver a query. If I really want to drive impact, I&#8217;ve got to, at the very least ask why. Why are we building this? Who is this for? What problem does it solve? And beyond that, how do I ensure it goes beyond me. Because in the end, if your dashboard or ML model never get&#8217;s implemented, it might as well have not been done. Read more...

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; When I first started in the data world back in 2015, Hadoop was everywhere. Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR, all promising to reshape the future of data. Fast forward a decade, and many newer practitioners don&#8217;t even recognize those names. And yet, for all the hype cycles and shiny new platforms, so many of the fundamental challenges in data haven&#8217;t really changed. But before that, if you're a data leader looking to understand what is going on in the broader data world as well as elevate your leadership skills, I recently released my self-paced Data Leaders Playbook Accelerator. If you'd like to check out the program, you can sign up here . Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! When I started in the data world back in 2015 Hadoop was at it&#8217;s peak. Actually I happened to be scrolling through an old instagram account and found a picture from a DAMA conference where Horton Works sponsored it(you can see it below). At the time, Hadoop and its ecosystem were everywhere, Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR, each promising to reshape the future of data. Fast forward just ten years and many newer practitioners don&#8217;t even recognize those names. And yet, in data engineering, a decade is barely enough time for fundamentals to change. Underneath the hype cycles and new logos, many of the same challenges remain. 1. Schema Design and Data Modeling Remain Essential How some companies approach data modeling has changed in the past decade since I first opened up Kimball . Many now lean on date partitions and table overwrites to simplify how they track history, instead of slowly changing dimensions. In addition, AI is beginning to influence the conversation. Tools can now help generate schema recommendations, flag inconsistencies, or even propose transformations based on usage patterns(actually this was going to be the project I took on at Facebook prior to leaving). But while those capabilities are new, the ...

## Post 119: The Inconvenient Truths of Self-Service Analytics

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; I&#8217;ve been speaking with data leaders and executives for the past few years about how to make data useful. And of course, self-service analytics comes up frequently. Some people believe in it, others don&#8217;t. So let&#8217;s talk about it! But before that, if you're a data leader looking to understand what is going on in the broader data world as well as elevate your leadership skills, consider signing up for my 6-Week Data Leaders Playbook Accelerator program that I will be running in September! Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! Self-service analytics is a hoax. A myth. The so-called holy grail. If you&#8217;ve worked in data long enough, you&#8217;ve heard that line. Maybe you&#8217;ve even thought it yourself, like the time your CEO asked for a &#8220;quick data pull&#8221; despite you building them a perfectly good dashboard that already answered the question. When I first entered the data world, self-service analytics was everywhere. Tableau was pushing it hard, then Salesforce bought them for $15.7 billion, and every vendor promised it would free analysts from endless requests. A decade later, we&#8217;re still chasing that dragon. Now the narrative has shifted: dashboards are &#8220;dead,&#8221; or the problem was that Tableau and Looker just &#8220;never did it right.&#8221; Say that self-service is a failure in the wrong room, and someone will tell you, &#8220;You were just doing it wrong.&#8221; Wherever you stand on the debate, I want to explore where self-service has struggled, and what might actually work next. Self-Service&#8217;s Inconvenient Truths Here are a few uncomfortable truths that even the strongest believers in self-service can&#8217;t deny: It&#8217;s been over a decade&#8230; and companies of all sizes are still struggling to answer basic questions. Instead of fixing the root cause, they just keep migrating tools, hoping the next one will magically solve everything...

## Post 120: Anyone Else Struggling to Keep Up With Data Tools

Hi, fellow future and current Data Leaders; Ben here &#128075; I was skimming through the data engineering subreddit again and I found a post that I believe we can all relate to. It was titled &#8220;Are You Guys Managing To Keep Up&#8221;. Who hasn&#8217;t felt that way in the data world. Every day there is some new technology we have to learn or design approach that is being tested. So how do you keep up? That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll be discussing in this article! But before we jump in, I wanted to share a bit about Estuary , a platform I've used to help make clients' data workflows easier and am an adviser for. Estuary helps teams easily move data in real-time or on a schedule, from databases and SaaS apps to data lakes and warehouses, empowering data leaders to focus on strategy and impact rather than getting bogged down by infrastructure challenges. If you want to simplify your data workflows, check them out today. Now let&#8217;s jump into the article! Are you managing to keep up? One of the truths I&#8217;ve realized about working in the data world, and really the technology world, is that you can work a lifetime and never ever touch massive swaths of technologies. Like Sisyphus, you could spend every day pushing the boulder of new technology up the hill, only to have it roll down back to the bottom. You could only work on Snowflake or Databricks , and in twenty years, never have touched the other. Okay, that might be unlikely, given how some companies set up their data stacks. Somehow, even smaller companies are finding a way to use both. Probably some classic vendor-driven development . Still, if you&#8217;ve only worked in big tech, you might never see some of these solutions while working on unique tools that are developed in-house. So how do you actually keep up? That&#8217;s what the poster below asked the data engineering subreddit. Source There are thousands of articles to read, never-ending tutorials, and you&#8217;d probably be more likely to climb...

In this issue of the newsletter I wrote about the most useful skill to learn as a data professional, which I believe to be your ability to find points of maximum leverage in a business that drastically improve performance with relatively little effort. So the logical next question is, how? The answer is simple but not easy. Use patterns lifted from case studies . In this newsletter we&#8217;ll get into two of my favorite patterns and two case studies for each. Pattern 1: Lifting demand constraints Pattern 2: Plugging revenue leaks Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Lifting Demand Constraints As data professionals you&#8217;re probably familiar with things like funnel analysis. It&#8217;s an awesome way to find inefficiencies in sales and marketing processes. But you almost never think about demand. You can often get 2x to 10x improvements in sales or marketing ROI by fixing demand vs doing funnel analysis. Yes funnel analysis can reveal leakage, as we&#8217;ll explore later, but before going there, look at demand constraints first Doing that can mean anything from improving the offer, the product, positioning, pricing, etc. Here are two case studies where improving demand led to massive improvements in profitability. I&#8217;ve deliberately chosen non-SaaS examples to show that these patterns apply everywhere. Case Study 1: Improving restaurant profitability Restaurants are notorious for being low-margin, high-failure businesses. They&#8217;re capital intensive (the kitchen alone can cost $15,000 to $150,000) and have high fixed costs. Rents and operating costs are a constant drain. And yet profitable restaurants do exist. In an interview on the Tim Ferriss podcast Nick Kokonas, who is known for his partnership with chef Grant Achatz, owning several high-end restaurants and for founding the reservation business Tock, explains how he completely turned the restaurant model in its head. Demand for most restaur...

Last newsletter (on the most useful skill to learn as a data professional) turned out to be one of my best performing posts. I really appreciate all the wonderful comments and messages I received, and I promise to continue writing more about it. Which brings us to this issue. There are a handful of attitudes (or mindsets if you like) that enable you to start building this skill while still on the job. Tinkering without permission is by far my favorite. I&#8217;ve used this exact attitude to: Learn for free while on the job Cultivate more luck in my career Look for opportunities to make an impact I&#8217;ll show you exactly how to do all that in this newsletter. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! This post is public so feel free to share it. Share What is &#8220;tinkering without permission?&#8221; Tinkering is about being curious and trying things out. As you read books, articles, listen to podcasts, etc. certain ideas pique your interest and you&#8217;d want to explore them. The easiest way to explore is while on the job because you&#8217;ll be solving concrete problems not academic ones. All you have to do is find a good reason to explore, ideally one that aligns with your company&#8217;s goals or can benefit them somehow. If you can do that, you&#8217;ve just given yourself license to pursue your curiosity. Some of things you try won&#8217;t go anywhere, so it&#8217;s in your best interest to try things without asking for permission. It requires a little courage, but if you do it in your own time, or you can show how benefits the company, you&#8217;ll be fine. Let me give you some examples. Learn for free while on the job I first encountered data science back in 2014. I was a newly minted &#8220;data analyst&#8221; trying to expand my expertise beyond data engineering and my company had just hired their first data scientist. I got curious about what she did, so after talking with her for a while, I was peeved to learn I would need to take classes and get a degree ...

When I started out in data all I wanted was to have a long and satisfying career, to be compensated well regardless of advances in technology or the whims of the market and of course to love what I did. More importantly I wanted to build expertise . So I looked everywhere. Career books, videos, articles, podcasts but only found bits and pieces. The best book on the topic was Cal Newport&#8217;s So Good They Can&#8217;t Ignore You. It has a simple premise: If you focus on learning &#8220;rare and valuable skills&#8221; you&#8217;ll have a long and successful career, full of opportunities, satisfaction and compensation. That&#8217;s great, but what skills fit those criteria? Cal doesn&#8217;t give you a satisfactory answer, but I believe I found it, at least for data professionals: That skill is the ability to find points of maximum leverage that dramatically improve an organization with relatively less effort, articulate them as clearly and intelligently as possible (for myself and others) and then connect them to your knowledge and experience. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. By the way, when I say &#8220;organization&#8221; I don&#8217;t necessarily mean the entire company. It could be that, of course but it could also just be an org inside of a big company. In this issue I&#8217;ll try to achieve three things: First, I&#8217;ll show you why you should focus on finding these leverage points Second, I&#8217;ll give you ideas on how to learn them Finally, I&#8217;ll provide a couple of examples so you understand what I&#8217;m talking about What are points of leverage? Organizations are complex systems. The parts are interconnected, full of dependencies and feedback loops. This means that improvements to the parts don&#8217;t necessarily add up to overall improvement. Complexity also makes it so that organizations have points of leverage (also known as constraints) that drive most of the throughput. Effort...

Hello everyone. Yes I&#8217;m writing again! I thought the break would be longer, but it turns out I was putting undue pressure on myself for my writing to be perfectly aligned with a singular idea. What I enjoy instead is exploring ideas related to data engineering, analytics, decision making and business. I&#8217;ve read a lot of books and articles on those topics, learned some useful things and would love to share them. So you&#8217;ll get a slice of that in your inbox. I&#8217;ll keep them short and to the point, so you can read it in a few minutes and still get nuggets of insight. Here we go! Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Every organization has a goal. Once understood everything becomes clear. Data work is properly aligned and you&#8217;re no longer swimming in unanswered requests and overdue tickets. More often than not, if you ask stakeholders what the goal is, you&#8217;ll get different answers: A marketing executive might say &#8220;ROAS&#8221; or &#8220;CAC.&#8221; A sales executive might say &#8220;Close Rate&#8221; or &#8220;Deal Flow&#8221; A VP of finance might say &#8220;ROI&#8221; The CEO might say something like &#8220;Growth&#8221; It&#8217;s really easy to get caught up in these local-optima metrics and lose sight of the overall goal. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to see the impact of your work. Worse, it can get very discouraging. Usually the goal of any for-profit company is to make money . All the other metrics, like the ones we saw above, support that goal and can be thought of as necessary conditions. Nonprofit organizations also have goals. A hospital for example has a goal like health outcomes through patient care and research. The goal should be expressed as a single metric and come from the top. Until you get the executive board to agree on the goal, you&#8217;re doing yourself a disservice. In many cases the goal should come from them and be disseminated through t...

I love writing. When I started writing this newsletter, there were a lot of things I wanted to explore. I have enjoyed exploring them for the past three years and have amassed a decent following. Many of you have told me you&#8217;ve enjoyed my ideas and I&#8217;ve made a few good friends from it. But, I&#8217;ve kind of run out of things to say that haven&#8217;t already been said or aren&#8217;t being said by others. I see the same things repeated over and over, and I would repeat the same things if I was after engagement, but for me this is a labor of love and I want to keep it that way. I need to feel inspired to write again and to do that, I&#8217;m going to take a long break, not sure how long, at least till the end of the year. I&#8217;m going to write again but most likely not about data specifically. Most likely about business. Thank you for sharing this journey with me and I hope you stick around....

In a recent live event, my friend Timo Dechau and his collaborator Juliana asked the question: &#8220;Is analytics a growth function?&#8221; It&#8217;s a good question, but it has been bothering me ever since. In a separate post Elena Verna (of Elena&#8217;s Growth Scoop) writes: Growth is rooted in data. It&#8217;s about running activities that are measurable, trackable, and tied directly to user behavior and monetization outcomes. Marketing, on the other hand, includes plenty of things you&nbsp;_can&#8217;t_&nbsp;(and shouldn&#8217;t try to) measure in the same way - brand, comms, PR, community. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. It took me a while to figure out why it bothered me. I don&#8217;t consider myself a &#8220;growth hacker&#8221; and I don&#8217;t know much about it, but when an executive is asking you for &#8220;actionable insights&#8221; aren&#8217;t they looking for just that? And if that&#8217;s the case, does this mean you now have to learn growth hacking skills? That&#8217;s when I figured it out. My answer now? Not necessarily! I&#8217;m not interested in learning growth hacks necessarily. My main interest is figuring out how to help organizations improve. And that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean growth. Improvement doesn&#8217;t always mean growth The concept of growth hacking comes from the world of Venture Capital. In that world, exponential growth is necessary in order for a single portfolio company&#8217;s &#8220;exit event&#8221; (acquisition or going public) can make up for the entire portfolio regardless of the other company&#8217;s successes. However there are many businesses for whom improvement might mean &#8220;become profitable&#8221; or &#8220;build an enduring company&#8221; or &#8220;maximize freedom for the founder.&#8221; All these companies can benefit tremendously from using data to improve without necessarily requiring growth hacks.

## Post 127: What I've learned designing data systems

Last week I ran a poll on this newsletter and on LinkedIn to see what type of content you most want to see from me. The answer did not surprise me :) I&#8217;ve been trying to balance analytics and engineering content since I started this newsletter. And while the system design won, what this says to me is that I have to continue to straddle the line between analytics and engineering, so don&#8217;t fret. I will alternate posts between the two. This week&#8217;s post is about data system design. I&#8217;ve been designing data systems throughout my career. It started out building data warehouses on SQL Server using SSIS and stored procedures and continued onto cloud data platforms (BigQuery then Snowflake). Nowadays it&#8217;s mostly PostgreSQL (dbt) and some Python. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned: You can&#8217;t know all the requirements upfront My entire career, the one thing that has remained constant is how requirements keep changing as business needs evolve. This has made very apparent for me the need for a modular design . I covered modularity in my book Minimum Viable SQL Patterns, but that was in the context of SQL queries. Modularity is actually a system design pattern. The key is simple, self-contained components that can be reasoned about, developed and tested independently. A simple, evolvable architecture is crucial The traditional way systems are designed is to gather all requirements and then spend time designing the perfect system. This is known as BDUF (big design upfront). I&#8217;ve often found that even if I know (or think I know) the requirements, I have a really hard time designing a large system upfront. Some people have the ability to design the whole thing in their heads. That&#8217;s not me. In fact, I prefer to get started with a minimal design , where I outline the various elements of data transformation (simple boxes and arrows design) th...

## Post 128: Will AI Replace Data and Analytics Engineers?

When ChatGPT first burst on the scene in early 2023, with its ability to give seemingly intelligent answers and write seemingly perfect code, I have to admit I was worried. I thought I&#8217;d become obsolete. I thought our entire industry would be handed over to AI and I&#8217;d have to switch careers. That&#8217;s not exactly what happened but things have definitely changed. This issue of Data Patterns is sponsored by Sheet Army Knife , a privacy-first Chrome extension that cleans, formats, and anonymizes PII data in spreadsheets before you accidentally load it to an AI tool. It runs entirely on your machine to reduce privacy risks when using AI tools. Two years later, with AI hype at an all time high, one thing is clear to me. Data and analytics engineering work is not going anywhere! Instead, what&#8217;s happening is that data roles are becoming more multi-faceted. Data analysts are doing data science; data scientists are doing data engineering; data engineers are doing software engineering. As a self-procliamed data generalist (I&#8217;ve done analytics, data engineering and even some data science) this was more than welcome, but what I didn&#8217;t expect was for me to get into software engineering this late in my career. While my background is in computer science, I never wanted to get into software engineering, so when my manager asked me dive into Python I was a little concerned. I had never written a single line of Python in my life &#128513;! Copilot to the rescue! Once I realized I could use GenAI / LLMs to help me write the code, I noticed something very interesting. Not knowing how to write Python from scratch didn&#8217;t hinder me. As long as I could read AI-generated code and understand what it was doing I was fine! The key skill for me shifted from writing code to writing very clear design docs; and to write very clear design docs, you need to be REALLY good at system design and architecture. I soon realized data system design was a skill that was...

Last month I sent an email asking about metric trees to understand what was driving this interest. I had a lot of interesting conversations, so thank you to those of you who replied and talked with me. I love nerding out on data topics so the conversations were very enjoyable. One of the requests many of you had was on how to design interactive metric trees that cover the entire business. Thanks for reading Data Patterns!

We chatted last year while he was still building a metrics tree for the sales team and he was finally ready to reveal what they had built. Sergey runs the internal analytics team at Brightly Software. The following is an edited version of a conversation we had about his experience designing, implementing and using metric trees at Brightly. Agenda: Why did he choose to build a metrics tree? How specifically did he build it and how did he automate it? How is it being used and what&#8217;s the impact to the business? How he&#8217;s leveraging the tree to provide on-demand AI powered insights Interested? Let&#8217;s get into it. Why did they build a metric tree for sales? Ergest: Hi Sergey. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Can you provide some context about Brightly? What does the company do? Sergey: My pleasure! We're a B2B SaaS company selling a variety of cloud solutions to different verticals. Our largest market is probably education; we sell to schools and universities, and our focus is on asset management software. You know, when you need to submit a work order to get something fixed, that's our software. Sergey: Before metric trees, we were very reactive. Questions would pile up and we&#8217;d scramble to answer them. We had dashboards and reports but it felt more like &#8220;choose your own adventure.&#8221; We wanted to be seen as a partner rather than somebody who just gets asked a question and provides an answer.

## Post 130: Lift and Shift Rarely Works

When migrating an existing platform it&#8217;s very tempting to simply &#8220;lift and shift&#8221; the existing data assets into the new system as quickly as possible. This means you&#8217;re copying data and queries &#8220;as is&#8221; and focusing on getting them working with as little modifications as possible. I&#8217;ve seen his play out multiple times in my career but it rarely works long-term for two very important reasons: Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Yes you move quickly but all the tech debt and inadequate architecture design is carried forward into the new system. When you lift and shift you &#8220;copy / paste&#8221; the old system into a new environment. Eventually cracks will appear. You miss out on the opportunity to redesign the data architecture properly. Do you know the expression &#8220;never let a good crisis go to waste?&#8221; It applies here. A redesign gives you a chance to clean house and rethink your approach. Take the time to analyze the existing architecture, figure out what&#8217;s working and what needs to change, then come up with a plan where you can both update the design and deliver value incrementally. My good friend calls this method &#8220;steel threads&#8221; whereby you take a horizontal slice of your existing architecture, from source system to end product (e.g dashboard) and deliver that in the new platform. The beauty of this technique is that you not only deliver value incrementally and quickly, but you also validate your work by comparing key metrics in the two systems. These steel threads make a lot of sense to the business than vertical slices which only make sense to engineers (build the ETL first, the data model next, the metrics next and finally all the dashboards) Rethinking your data strategy is not for the faint of heart though. You need confidence, political capital and experience to convince stakeholders to give you a big budget with low initial R...

In Part 1 of the Art of Business Analysis series we looked at the Value Chain as a key framework for analyzing the business as a whole. In that post we looked at the case study of Chiro-1st which comprises a number of chiropractor studios in and around Washington state. We looked at the key metrics / KPIs and built a metrics tree using the value chain. There&#8217;s a link to that post later one, but it&#8217;s not strictly required to understand this one. I&#8217;ll provide just enough context here for you to be able to follow along. In this post we seek to answer the question: &#8220; How do we improve this business? &#8221; Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Improving Systems Through Constraints To answer that question we&#8217;ll look at another powerful framework for analyzing businesses called Theory of Constraints (TOC). I will not get too deep in the weeds of TOC because the knowledge base is vast, I&#8217;ll just focus on what you can use today. TOC takes a wholistic systems approach to improvement. The core tenet is that every system has a goal. A constraint is a limiting factor that prevents the system from reaching that goal. It&#8217;s whatever resource you don&#8217;t have enough of to get the goal. TOC also believes that this constraint is the only thing that matters and the only thing you should focus on to improve that system. This is quite a departure from the traditional approach which seeks to improve a business by optimizing every part independently. The constraint acts as a point of leverage, in the sense that improving just the constraint by 10x gets you 10x improvements in the entire business. Improving anything other than the constraint will get you, at best, incremental improvements. The five types of constraints According to Dr Alan Barnard (who worked directly with and was mentored by TOC founder Dr Goldratt) there are only 5 types of constraints: Demand constraint (also known as...

When I was a business analyst circa 2015 I had no clue how businesses worked despite the MBA degree I had received a decade earlier. Back then I used to think that analyzing a business meant analyzing various metrics and coming up with stories that explained those metrics. I did my best, but ultimately failed and decided to focus on data engineering instead. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Almost a decade later, I have discovered a number of analytical frameworks and tools that I know for a fact would have helped me succeed. I would have become an expert analyst and a trusted advisor to the executive leadership. And so I&#8217;ve decided to write this post as a message to my younger self. The most interesting of these tools and frameworks is the Metrics/KPI Tree. It's the best tool I know for understanding and communicating business context. I&#8217;ve written about it in the past and since then, I&#8217;ve seen that people are very interested to learn more about it. What I want to do is write a series of posts (directed to my younger self) where I walk through the steps of building it from scratch. I&#8217;ll be using a business case study I saw in a video by Alex Hormozi where he advises a business owner of chiropractor studios on reaching the goal of $5 million in EBITDA in 3 years. Of courtse I&#8217;m no Alex Hormozi, I don&#8217;t have his experience running and growing businesses, so this is just my take. The link to Hormozi&#8217;s video is at the end of this post. Business Overview The case study concerns a business called Chiro 1st which comprises a number of chiropractor studios in and around Washington state. These are physical locations where doctors perform chiropractic treatments for patients, such as various adjustments, rehabilitation and spinal decompression. The owner states that spinal decompression is their unique value proposition. Since this is a physical business (as opposed to a ...

## Post 134: Understanding Business Context

A lot gets written about the importance of understanding the business context but rarely do I see anything written about how to do it. As I&#8217;ve progressed in my career, I&#8217;ve learned that getting up to speed quickly is essential to delivering value with data. In this issue I will explain a simple framework I have developed and refined over time to get 80% of the way in 20% of the time. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. The best part of this framework is its simplicity but don&#8217;t let that fool you. There&#8217;s a lot more nuance behind it. And the more you use it the better you will get at understanding the business context and the easier it will become to deliver value with data. Interested? Let&#8217;s get to it. By the way, if you want to get even deeper into the business context, I suggest you learn about the competitive landscape of your company. The best tool for that is the Wardley Map which I&#8217;ve written about in a previous issue you can find in the archives. The framework consists of three pillars: 1. The business model and its unit economics 2. The demand side (aka why are customers searching, buying and using the product) 3. The supply / operations side (aka how the company fulfills this demand) Business model and unit economics The business model is usually the first thing you learn. It's already public information so you can learn this even before you join a company. For example the key metrics of a SaaS business can be learned in a single (amazing) article by David Skok called SaaS Metrics 2.0 . VCs are more than happy to teach this stuff because they want more businesses like that to invest in. The business model describes how the company captures the value it creates or said more simply &#8220;how they make money.&#8221; There will likely be a lot of nuance in any one particularly business, such as &#8220;usage based pricing (e.g. buy 1000 credits for $100]&#8221; or &#8...

## Post 135: Why Do Companies Hire Data Professionals?

Why do companies hire data professionals? Do you ever ask yourself that? Oh sure there&#8217;s the job description that tells you what the role is supposed to do, but look beyond it for just a minute and something amazing happens. As data professionals we tell ourselves that &#8220;we help stakeholders make data driven decisions.&#8221; In many cases this value means helping the company grow. But what if the company was already growing while the data function is in shambles? Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. There was a company I heard about that was making multiple tens of millions in ARR while all its reporting was still being done in Excel. People manually extracted data from various systems and dumped it in Excel. They had hired a data scientist but their main problem was not data science. They needed to consolidate multiple scattered data sources into a common warehouse so that reporting could be automated. It&#8217;s quite common for companies to hire &#8220;for the future&#8221; and get someone with a PhD to do data science while their most pressing problem lies in engineering. I&#8217;m sure you know what I&#8217;m talking about. Anyways, the question in the back of my mind was &#8220;why didn&#8217;t they hire someone earlier?&#8221; Then came the shocking realization: &#8220;If they were growing regardless of data quality, does this mean that having standardized, well modeled data doesn&#8217;t contribute much to growth?&#8221; As data professionals we debate a lot among ourselves about the value of data, but we never ask the crucial question of how stakeholders perceive that value. We act as if this value is self evident: &#8220;Of course you&#8217;d want clean, structured data!&#8221; But as far as stakeholders are concerned, we have to dig further to figure it out. And the reason why we have to figure it out is that once we understand the driver, it will make our career growth a lot easier. So...

There is a silent struggle in your company that you as a data professional can fix with very little effort while at the same time demonstrating the tremendous value of the data team. But there&#8217;s a problem&#8230;.you&#8217;re most likely blind to it. And to add insult to injury they don&#8217;t even know you could do this easily. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Time for a history lesson. When I was a business analyst one of the things I was often asked to do was to sit in and shadow operations teams (marketing, sales, customer service, etc.) Every now and then I&#8217;d notice them doing things that would baffle me. While on the phone with a customer, a salesperson would jump between several applications (CRM, email, Excel, etc) to answer customer questions. Other times they would be copy/pasting information from these systems into Excel to create reports that were used by the whole team. Flabbergasted I would ask why they were doing this. To them this was just how things worked, they had no idea I could write a SQL query in 10 minutes and automate away hours of meaningless work. Productivity gains would be tremendous. On the other hand, the requests I was getting for data and reports were nothing like what I was witnessing. I started calling this &#8220;suffering in silence.&#8221; They had no idea I could solve their problems with very little effort while I had no idea they needed this in the first place. How to avoid the data service desk trap I often joke that the moment you walk into a company as a data professional asking what their data needs are, you&#8217;ve fallen into the &#8220;data service desk trap.&#8221; You think you&#8217;re being helpful instead you&#8217;re setting yourself up for endless toil. You see, business users are often unaware of what data and information is available, or could be easily obtained from existing infrastructure. They also don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s possi...

Before getting into data engineering I tried my hand at data analysis. I hated it. I just couldn&#8217;t figure out what people wanted out of data. Whatever questions I could answer led to more questions and whatever features I could add to a dashboard led to even more feature requests. It was incredibly frustrating. Even when I asked people what they wanted, gathered data requirements, built and released multiple reports and dashboards it never seemed to satisfy. On top of that, the dashboards wouldn&#8217;t even be used. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This led to frustration on both sides and ended with me abandoning the analyst role in favor of data engineering. I thought I wasn&#8217;t cut out for it. It wasn&#8217;t until I got introduced to metric trees that I realized I this was exactly what I had been missing. All I needed was a framework for mapping data requests to business objectives. As you know I have talked about metric trees (aka KPI trees) multiple times in my posts but never in the context of bringing clarity to business objectives. And to understand how, we first must let go of a misconception. A common misconception As a data professional with multiple years of experience you&#8217;ve probably gotten burned a few times jumping through hoops to answer a seemingly very important last minute question only to find out later that it was a mere curiosity. Given such harrowing experiences, it&#8217;s really easy to assume executives don&#8217;t know what they want, especially when they keep changing their minds, never use the dashboards we make and keep asking more questions. But we&#8217;d be wrong. Executives know exactly what they want, they just can&#8217;t communicate it in a way that data teams can understand. What they really want is to understand the causal relationships between the inputs (levers) that they control to the outputs (goals and objectives) of the business. Rather than r...

Hello everyone and welcome back to Data Patterns. I know it has been a while since my last newsletter. I only wanted to take a short break over the holidays but here we are 3 months later. Don&#8217;t worry; everything is fine and I&#8217;m ready to fire on all cylinders again! I&#8217;ve got an interesting post and an announcement for you today. So without further ado let&#8217;s get into it. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. The expert data analyst When you think about expertise and improving your skills as a data professional what&#8217;s the first thing that comes to mind? If you&#8217;re like most people, I bet the answer is &#8220;technical skills.&#8221; Learn a new programming language (like SQL, Python, R, etc.); learn a new technique or methodology (AI is pretty hot these days, right?) and so on. But expertise doesn&#8217;t work that way. Experts are valued for knowing the stuff that cannot be easily googled or prompted into an LLM. This is known as tacit (intuitive) knowledge. What makes experts rare and valuable are their intuitions about their domain. And that can only be learned from experience. If it can be googled or prompted it might be valuable but it&#8217;s not rare enough. So you can learn new technologies all day long but never become an expert. Ok, Ergest how do I develop rare and valuable skills? The data expertise triad First we need to understand our objective. As a data professional what do you want out of your career in data? Ideally you want to have a successful, enjoyable and long lasting career. Which means: Making meaningful contributions to the organization with your skills Carving out an important role for yourself (and your team) in the organization Creating leverage for yourself (and your team) that can be parlayed into promotions, raises and future opportunities Pretty good right? So how do we get there? Since I love triads so much, I now present to you the Data Experti...

I recently had an in-depth conversation with a data leader (whom I&#8217;ll call Emma) about her experience implementing metric trees at a startup. She&#8217;s currently director of data and she runs a small team of analysts and engineers. Thanks for reading Data Patterns! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. I reached out to her after she graciously pledged $8/mo to support this newsletter. I still don&#8217;t accept payments by the way but it was surprising to me that I had provided enough value to warrant a subscription. In our first call, Emma mentioned how my post on metric trees motivated her to build her own and the results had been incredible. Metric trees helped her: Drastically reduce requests on the data team Easily prioritize data questions from stakeholders Increase the company&#8217;s operational clarity Empower the data team to own outcomes Increase data team&#8217;s impact on the business Shift data team&#8217;s role from order takers to internal consultants Dramatically boost data team&#8217;s impact and morale Not bad for a simple tool, right? The only problem was that we didn&#8217;t record that call, so I was very keen on having another call where we dove into the specifics. This post focuses on the Growth Model and Leadership &amp; Influence legs of the triad I introduced last time. The Interview Me: Hi Emma, last time we talked you shared your experience with building a metrics tree at your company and how it basically transformed the data culture there. Would you mind sharing your experience? Emma: Absolutely! It all started when I realized that despite being immersed in data, I was struggling to understand the levers we could pull to improve our business. The data team was bogged down with too many questions and requests most of which seemed ad-hoc. We were acting more like a service function reacting to others' needs. I realized we needed to be more proactive and prescriptive. We couldn't help the business if we didn'...

Celery is the go to name for Python web developers for distributed task management. With lesser efforts anyone can develop a distributed task system. All it takes is a configuration like takes is an instantiation of the class and a decorator over a python method. A simplified example is below.&nbsp; from celery import Celery app = Celery( namespace="celery_demo_app", broker="redis://localhost:6379/1", backend="redis://localhost:6379/2" ) @app.task(name="tasks.addition") def addition_task(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int: c = 0 try: c = a+b except TypeError: print(f"type of a --&gt; {type(a)} and type of b --&gt; {type(b)}") finally: return a+b So simple and elegant right? Now I want to push this to my production system. Now the problem starts. I will have all type of questions like, How can I see what is happening in my tasks? How many of my tasks failed? Are all the tasks delivered to my worker? Is my worker available all the time? What is the consumption level of my broker? Is there a way I can retry my task with minimal changes?&nbsp; And whatnot &#129335; Let me take you through the basic settings of Celery which will help in reducing stress on above questions and some more. Let&#8217;s categorize the settings in three major categories - Robustness and System reliability. Each category has its subdivisions and we will discuss them in detail. Robustness High availability Redis/RabbitMQ as brokers In the entire architecture of distributed systems, the one point failure is the broker. So how to avoid it? Make it a highly available system. You can either use redis&#8217; master slave approach ( https://hevodata.com/learn/redis-high-availability/ ), or sentinel ( https://redis.io/docs/management/sentinel/ ) provided by redis labs, Queue mirroring for RabbitMQ(https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html) anything works. Make sure always your broker is up and ready to serve messages between task producers and consumers.&nbsp; Autoscaling of workers Robustness is needed at worker level t...

In the previous two issues, the content was scattered, which may have distracted readers from focusing on a particular topic. Starting from now, each issue will focus on a specific topic or principle related to broad topics such as web scraping, data engineering, and software development. This issue will focus on one of the fundamental aspects of system design, which is logging. Whether you're writing a small script or a distributed software system, logging is a fundamental component for understanding the behavior, performance, and state of execution. However, logging can also become a bottleneck if it consumes too much time or is over-engineered. In this newsletter, we have classified the articles based on three parts of logging: collection or aggregation, processing, and visualization. These three aspects are essential for effective logging and monitoring of your software systems. Before we dive into the topic in detail, here are a few well-written articles that explain the fundamentals, design, and challenges of logging. What is log? How it should be considered?

I have participated in numerous debates regarding the appropriate terminology for a certain process, thing, or event, and often found myself losing friends or making enemies by the end of such discussions.&nbsp; I am taking another crack at this, my first post on my technical blog, I will be classifying the differences between web scraping and web crawling. Additionally, I will cover some basic terminologies used in the scraping discipline and explain why they are used in that way. To begin with, the correct term is web scraping, not scrapping. Scrapping usually refers to disposing of unwanted items, as per the thesaurus. Whenever I come across companies using "scrapping" in their job descriptions, I never applied. In fact, I have, and will continue to, reject applicants who have previously engaged in "web scrapping" during their past jobs. Thanks for reading @FluffyDietEngine&#8217;s Substack! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Another commonly held misconception in the community is &#8220; Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup &#8221;. While beautifulsoup is a versatile Python library, it does not actually scrape web pages. Rather, it parses the Document Object Model (DOM) of the response obtained by other libraries capable of connecting to the internet, such as requests , httpx , aiohttp , and so on. At one point, I had to verify the documentation of BeautifulSoup to ensure I had not overlooked a crucial feature of the library. Even my favorite educational website for Python programming, realpython.com,&nbsp; has done the same mistake in a tutorial to talk about &#8220; web scraping with BeautifulSoup ''. It is a great article though. I can understand your thoughts: do these things really matter? Yes, as someone who started their career as a Junior Data Engineer and has spent eight years in the industry specializing in web data extraction with Python, these things do matter to me. And I would like to share my insights with my peers. Now, let's...

Data Contracts have been a widely discussed subject in the data community. Contrary to volatile trends and strategies, contracts have proven to be tangible, given it directly addresses recurrent concerns in data stacks across organisations and industries; also because of our ability to experiment directly with it instead of getting trapped in conceptual debates. In this issue, we address some practical concerns and solutions regarding data contracts. Good news is we&#8217;ve curated an amazing load of insights from a very influential cast who&#8217;ve practically participated in the ideation and development of the Data Contract paradigm. Yes, we are talking founding engineers, authors, evangelists, and contributors of open specifications! To make the experience more consumable, we&#8217;ve divided these insights across a three-part series: Part 1: What and Why of Contracts Part 2: Contract Ops Part 3: Contract Ops (continued) Our last release was a massive boost for many readers as they could access distilled information from across a wide range of experts and form their own opinion around the suggested solutions and ideas, and this release is in a similar vein. We encountered varying approaches to data contracts; while there's unanimous agreement for some strategies, there are also stark differences in opinions around some debatable topics, which could be a very interesting turn on how we approach this novel technology.

## Post 153: Data Maturity, Part 3

**Author:** Colleen Tartow

**Published:** 2024-06-05T13:58:10+00:00

**Content Preview:**
A few years back, Annika and I started this blog because we had ideas about data maturity. We wrote about what data maturity was in Part 1 , and how that extended to analytics in Part 2 . Over the years I keep coming back to this idea of data maturity, and it&#8217;s become incredibly relevant once again now that we&#8217;re in the midst of the genAI hype cycle . So buckle up, it&#8217;s time for Part 3 &#128588; Data Maturity, previously The conclusion we came to in our previous articles (spoiler alert!) was: &#10024; to be mature in analytics, a company must be mature in data &#10024; So what does Data Maturity even mean? In the past we divided organizations into low and high data maturity: &#10145;&#65039; Low data maturity A low data maturity, or data immature, organization doesn&#8217;t know a lot about data, and it typically hasn&#8217;t been a priority for them. They have very few experienced data people, and they&#8217;re not using much beyond Excel / Powerpoint / an old school ERP or basic accounting system. They&#8217;ve likely got reporting under control but when it comes to anything beyond very simple dashboards or SQL queries against source DBs, they&#8217;re just not there. &#10145;&#65039; High data maturity A highly data mature team, on the other hand, has a solid handle on data engineering, and data science is a priority. Data is treated like a product. Many people are proficient in Python &amp; SQL. They focus on accelerating the time-to-value for data, and the company thinks ahead when it comes to data. They&#8217;re strategic about data technology, and data is a steady investment target/priority amongst leadership. Adding deep learning to the equation So how does AI fit in? In my previous article of March 2021, I said &#8220;For years I have been annoying people who want to bring data science into their orgs by telling them that 90% of the work is the data.&#8221;&nbsp; I still say this today 3+ years later, but now in reference to deep learning ...

Lately I&#8217;ve been to a LOT of data conferences. Recently, I was at the ODSC East conference in Boston - they&#8217;d asked me to give a talk about Data Mesh . Lately I&#8217;ve been speaking more about AI , structured vs unstructured data, and whether the Modern Data Stack is still a thing . I&#8217;ve also made a lot of memes &#128526; One question I&#8217;ve been asked a lot lately is, &#8220;what&#8217;s going on with Data Mesh?&#8221; and &#8220;is Data Mesh still a thing?&#8221; &#128064; So let&#8217;s take a minute to talk about it. Why care about Data Mesh? I wrote a little book about Data Mesh, and I&#8217;ve been a huge proponent of it for years now. Back in the day I was a data engineering and analytics leader; even further back in the day I was a data engineer &#129299; I&#8217;ve felt first-hand the pain points that are prevalent in a centralized data organization at a growing company. I know how hard it is for data teams to be the bottleneck in the flow of data from source to value, because I&#8217;ve lived it. Do I think Data Mesh is a magic wand, that can miraculously fix all the problems? Eh. But do I think Data Mesh is a necessary and huge leap forward in data strategy? You bet I do. Thanks for reading The Sequel! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Where is Data Mesh now? In 2021-ish, Data Mesh was the hottest thing in data. People loved it or hated it, it spawned communities and conferences and books and a million blogs. Then, as with all things in the zeitgeist, we moved on. Other ideas took over in dominating the hype cycle, and while Data Mesh didn&#8217;t go away, it was no longer the belle of the ball. But a mature data strategy is more relevant than ever now. Things on the Data Mesh front have been relatively quiet of late, and I have a theory of why this is: It takes a long time to build out a Data Mesh. Years. So the organizations that were excited to get started in the last few years are now deep in the weed...

It&#8217;s been a hot minute 1 , eh?&nbsp; Do I have a hundred blog ideas for this blog that went half-written and are saved somewhere in draft form?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Am I going to revisit some of them?&nbsp; Eh, maybe.&nbsp; Life is busy .&nbsp; Case in point: my older son is now old enough to watch Star Wars &#129395; We watched the Skywalker Saga movies in chronological release order, and now we&#8217;re watching The Mandalorian, as you may have gleaned from the title.&nbsp; So what does this have to do with AI? Mando does not like Droids In the Star Wars universe, artificial intelligence largely manifests as droids.&nbsp; Some are humanoid like C-3PO , some are not (shoutout to Gonk ), and some are a hybrid, like IG-11 . Without spoiling anything, the Mandolorian is a bounty hunter who loathes droids generally. He hates IG-units specifically as they were also bounty hunters and were designed, literally, to kill.&nbsp; Mando also works with an Ugnaught , Kuill , who can fix anything and has been known to reprogram droids, including these killer IG-units, to be docile house servants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mando, however, has a really hard time trusting droids. AI as Droids &#129302; So what the heck does any of this have to do with the current explosion of AI in the tech world?&nbsp; We were watching The Mandalorian this weekend, and in a conversation with Kuill, the Ugnaught said something I can&#8217;t get out of my head: &#8220;Droids are not good or bad, they are neutral reflections of those who imprint them.&#8221;&nbsp; His point is that for Mando to hate on droids generally is foolish because they&#8217;re simply computers, and it&#8217;s the people who programmed them who are responsible for their behavior.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s really people who are the problem &#128161; Nick Nolte.&nbsp; No, really .&nbsp;&nbsp; AI is not good or bad&#8230; So the real-world analogy here is that AI is neither good nor bad, it si...

So how does a champagne brunch buffet come together?&nbsp;&nbsp; This nirvana is truly greater than the sum of its parts.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got pastry chefs baking, a team running the omelette station, a sushi chef, folks chopping veggies for salads, a pasta station, carving station, charcuterie, etc.&nbsp; Each kitchen team focuses on the ingredients they need to pull together the product - the eggs or fruit or flour or specific baking dishes.&nbsp; The end product - what ends up on my plate - is a delightful mix of what I like - a bit of crunch, a bit of savory, and a bit of sweet &#127859;&#127843;&#129360;&#127837;&#127790; And, of course, champagne &#129346; A data buffet What does this have to do with data?

This is Part Two in a two-part series. Part One here . TL;DR Snowflake is moving into processing. Databricks is moving into storage. The two hottest data companies in the world are looking increasingly similar. I wrote about this shift a couple months ago, in Snowbricks &amp; Dataflake: Part One . Here in Part Two, I&#8217;m diving into a fascinating parallel I stumbled upon. The more I dug into the histories of Snowflake &amp; Databricks, the more similarities I found to two of the world&#8217;s most storied enterprise software companies: SAP and Oracle. After 50 years of SAP &amp; Oracle reigning as data storage &amp; processing powerhouses, Snowflake and Databricks are the up-and-coming 21st century duo with a shot at enterprise software domination. SAP &amp; Oracle&#8230; really? Now, for the skeptics saying &#8220;But SAP &amp; Oracle are multi-faceted enterprise software, that&#8217;s totally different from these analytics companies&#8221; &#8212;you&#8217;re not wrong. I&#8217;m not suggesting the business models of SAP/Oracle &amp; Snowflake/Databricks are one and the same, or that they&#8217;re solving the same customer need today. That said, there is an important point of overlap in the Venn diagram that is worth noting&#8212;specifically, a core tenet of both pairs is that they provide a unified storage layer for enterprise data. As a result, these four companies are similar in their DNA: each one is a critical, hugely important piece of enterprise infrastructure. While these companies&#8212;especially the newer pair&#8212;claim to serve clients of all shapes and sizes, the bulk of their revenues mostly come from the higher end of the market (e.g., Fortune 500). Die-hard data folks might think that SAP is an odd-one out in this foursome. Yes, Oracle has a much deeper database DNA (one friend described Oracle to me as &#8220;a database that happens to be used as an ERP&#8221;), and it falls more frequently into the Teradata/Redshift/etc. comparisons than S...

TL;DR Snowflake is moving into processing. Databricks is moving into storage. The two hottest data companies in the world are looking more and more similar to one another, with increasingly overlapping offerings and ambitions. The stage is being set for quite the competitive dynamic, one that is reminiscent of previous-gen enterprise giants SAP &amp; Oracle. Snow &amp; Bricks Unless you&#8217;re living under a rock, you know that Snowflake and Databricks are two of the hottest companies in data land right now. While Snowflake has been a household name in data circles for awhile, it was the company&#8217;s 2020 IPO that thrusted them into the mainstream, after an impressive up-and-to-the-right trajectory. Databricks isn&#8217;t far behind &#8212; having raised at a $28 billion valuation earlier this year , they&#8217;re said to be another likely IPO candidate. These companies started off in fairly distinct markets&#8212;what they were initially known for, at their cores, is pretty different: Snowflake is the data warehouse company Databricks is the Spark company As they&#8217;ve matured, they&#8217;ve been expanding their offerings and creeping into one another&#8217;s space&#8212;and their visions of what they&#8217;re going after sound nearly identical. This a very interesting and under-discussed competitive dynamic that I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve come across very often. Let&#8217;s dig in. How it started: Snowflake started as a Data Warehouse company. As I wrote in the history section of The Generalist&#8217;s Snowflake S-1 Club report , Snowflake was founded in 2012 by ex-Oracle database architects who had a vision of building a cloud-native data warehouse from the ground up. The market was ripe, the timing was right, and the company has executed near-flawlessly: fast-forward nine years and they&#8217;re doing over $500M a year in revenue and sitting at a $70B market cap. To bring some context to where Snowflake began, I think about the data stack as four bucke...

But what about your data itself?&nbsp; Shouldn&#8217;t data and data science be, you know, math?&nbsp; And therefore kind of immune to prejudice?&nbsp; Data is really just 1s and 0s - electrons!&nbsp; Electrons aren&#8217;t biased, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; But - as we all know by now - that&#8217;s not true. Bias can happen in the data itself, and everyone in data-related fields should be thinking about this a lot, especially as data-based fields grow in popularity and adoption.&nbsp; There are a lot of ways skew can be introduced, from how the data is collected to how it&#8217;s presented.&nbsp; This is an incredibly complex and hairy topic, and like many I also get overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of the problem &#128555; But that doesn&#8217;t mean we can ignore it, so in the interest of brevity I&#8217;m going to hone in on three basic sources of bias here: The data itself &#128203; Algorithms &#128200; Humans &#129299; Your data might be a problem &#128561; Datasets can be incredibly straightforward and transactional (e.g. invoice data) but they can also be skewed in several ways - due to how they&#8217;re collected, how they&#8217;re sampled, how they&#8217;re interpreted&#8230; think about any push poll as an obvious example.&nbsp; Data issues can be more subtle, too. Think about something that seems simple like a &#8220;gender&#8221; field &#9892;or a &#8220;race&#8221; field. Most datasets are split into only two or three genders and a handful of races, and ignore...

TL;DR&nbsp; Spoiler alert: your first data hire should be a senior data engineer who can help you architect, build, and mature your data ecosystem, and do some basic analytics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do data! Congratulations!&nbsp; You&#8217;re a leader who&#8217;s been put in charge of getting your company to build out a data function. That means you&#8217;re the one tasked with buying tools and making the first hire - an exciting prospect.&nbsp; Woot!&nbsp; &#127881; Beware Analysis Paralysis As exciting as standing up a data team is, it can also be pretty daunting. &#129489;&#8205;&#128187; Who do you hire first? A data analyst?&nbsp; An analytics engineer?&nbsp; A data engineer?&nbsp; A business analyst?&nbsp; A data leader?&nbsp; &#128176; Where do you allocate your budget? Should you buy some shiny new BI tools and convince one of your software engineers to &#8220;start doing data&#8221;?&nbsp; Or should you blow all of your budget on a super expensive data scientist and trust that you&#8217;ll be able to make do with your existing tools? &#128563; Or do you just curl up under your desk with a severe case of analysis paralysis? Where should you start? First: chill out, it&#8217;s going to be OK.&nbsp; Second: let&#8217;s look at things in the context of Data Maturity . We define this as a function of a company's people &#129299;, tools &#128736;, and readiness &#127937;. You've identified the people need, and let's assume you have at least decent readiness, since you're the business leader driving this effort. Now it's time to think about the tools you'll need, and that will very much depend on where your critical data lives -- so it&#8217;s worth starting by taking an inventory of that: What kind of data do you have? It could be transactional, sales history, customer data, inventory, clickstream, marketing, etc.&nbsp; What are the key use cases that are driving this data need? Are there certain business-level KPIs or OKRs relating back to specific datasets? ...

TL;DR In data, more than in any other functional area, we segment people based on whether they&#8217;re in or they&#8217;re out &#8212; &#8216;data people&#8217; vs. &#8216;non-data people&#8217;. While there are obvious reasons for this, it causes a divide that makes me uneasy. If we want to create data-centric cultures within our companies, we should be blurring the lines between the two worlds. One foot in, one foot out As a kid, I used to straddle the Canada/US border, thinking it was just the coolest thing that I was in two countries at once. I thought it was so cool that I did it on the equator, too Many times over, I&#8217;ve felt like that in my work. I&#8217;ve always had one foot on either side of the line. I&#8217;m a &#8216;business person&#8217;. I studied Finance in college. I&#8217;m obsessed with EBITDA and generating business value and building companies. I love a good high-level, conceptual debate about corporate strategy or go-to-market approach or tactics for building an enterprise sales team. But I&#8217;m also a &#8216;data person&#8217;. I studied Math in college, too. I vividly remember learning Bayes&#8217; theorem and analyzing my first A/B test and being awed by the power of statistics being applied in a company at scale. I used to thrive on late nights debugging my SQL code. I&#8217;d love to discuss the implications of ELT vs. ETL with you just as much as I&#8217;d love to spar on corporate strategy or macroeconomics. As people working in the field of data, why do we delineate so clearly between data people and non-data people? With data becoming such a critical input to, like every aspect of business in this day and age, isn&#8217;t it kind of concerning that we draw such a clear line in the sand? We don&#8217;t talk about &#8216;non-sales&#8217; or &#8216;non-product&#8217; people in the same way we talk about &#8216;non-data&#8217; people.

TL;DR In this post, I walk through how data maturity is directly related to analytics maturity. Bottom line: to even think about analytics maturity, a company has to first focus on its data. A quick recap of Part 1 In Annika&#8217;s post Data Maturity, Part 1 , she presented this matrix, where we not only think about a company&#8217;s size but how data mature they are: To be honest, when Annika first brought this up to me, it kind of blew my mind. It&#8217;s so simple and so clear, and it codifies that company size doesn&#8217;t dictate data maturity, like, at all. Rather, data maturity is therefore a measure of how advanced a company&#8217;s people, tools, and processes are with respect to data specifically.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an important aspect to consider for any company. The analytics maturity model I&#8217;ve been in the data and analytics world for a long time now &#128117;&#127995;&#129299; I&#8217;ve worked with small companies where nearly everyone used data to make decisions, mid-market companies in the throes of a digital transformation beginning to include data in their processes, and large, complex, established companies where they&#8217;d love to be data-driven but it&#8217;s a distant dream buried under spreadsheets.&nbsp;&nbsp; The data maturity model immediately brought to mind Gartner&#8217;s analytics maturity model, which has become the stuff of legend in the analytics world.&nbsp; It basically looks like this: Put simply, it&#8217;s harder to do things that are of higher value when it comes to analytics.&nbsp; Shocking, I know! &#128521;&nbsp; But seriously - most companies can do really (low-value, easy) basic analytics in the form of reporting.&nbsp; But to get to the place where you can do predictive or prescriptive (high-value, hard) data science and run your business based on data?&nbsp; Dude, that&#8217;s tough! &nbsp;And it doesn&#8217;t just mean you need genius data scientists and operationalized data, it means you need to treat data as ...

TL;DR Becoming a data-driven organization takes time and effort. There&#8217;s no magic wand. &#129497;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; Getting real about where your company sits on the &#8216;data maturity&#8217; spectrum is a great place to start. In this post we&#8217;ll cover: What is data maturity? Why company size is a bad proxy for data maturity How data maturity looks in practice This is Part 1 of 2. In Part 2, Colleen will discuss Data Maturity as a necessary precursor to Analytics Maturity. What is data maturity? My shorthand definition of data maturity is &#8216;how data-savvy a company is&#8217;. Broadly speaking, I consider data maturity to be a function of three things: People , Tools , and Readiness &#128119;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039; On the people front:&nbsp; Do people in the company have experience with the latest data &amp; analytics technologies? Is there even a data team? Are they using the company&#8217;s proprietary data to the best of their ability? Are they hungry to continually upgrade their tooling and their thinking to remain at the forefront of what&#8217;s possible? How do &#8216;non-data&#8217; roles in the company feel about data? &#128736; On the tools front:&nbsp; Is the company using a modern data stack, or are they working off of&nbsp;.XLS files and building graphs in Powerpoint? Where are they storing &amp; accessing their data? Do they have a lot of data debt ? &#128681; On the readiness front: Do they have a good understanding &amp; articulation of what they want to accomplish with data? Do the company&#8217;s leadership have the mindset to actually be data-led? Do they know what business outcomes they hope to drive? Do they know what data sources&#8202; they need&#8202;, and how? Basically&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;have they done their homework in figuring out what they need, or did they just hear &#8220;big data&#8221; and go looking for a magic wand? &#129497;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039; Why company size is a bad proxy for Data Maturity I often hear ...

Hey there. &#128075; We&#8217;re Annika &amp; Colleen. We&#8217;re a couple of enterprise data nerds on a mission to bring more conversation to what we call &#8216;the human side of data&#8217;. Today, we&#8217;re launching The Sequel &#8212; a newsletter doing just that. Here&#8217;s some background &#128071; &#128293; Data is heating up &#8212; and it&#8217;s here to stay We've finally reached the point where data is everywhere. It&#8217;s being analyzed and applied in businesses of all shapes &amp; sizes &#8212; from tech-forward Fortune 500s, to analog pizza chains. Data is officially *kind of a big deal* . And it's not that Analytics, Data Science, or Machine Learning are new disciplines &#8212; it's that data is becoming more available &amp; more useful than ever before. Why is that? A few reasons: &#9729; The cloud becoming a thing &#128736; Huge advances in analytics tools &#128200; The staggering amount of data being created in our increasingly digital world Unless you're living under a rock, you probably already know all this. And even if you didn't know it explicitly, you probably felt it. Data is the new &#8216;lingua franca&#8217; of business. &#128014; But, it&#8217;s still the wild west Despite how much attention data is getting, it&#8217;s still early days. Companies everywhere are scrambling to ' do data ', and to get the right people in place for the job. We hear of companies setting aside budgets to hire Machine Learning experts &#8212; when they're still using Excel as their source of truth. We see job postings for new types of roles popping up, as companies retroactively uncover fundamental gaps in their capabilities. We hear debates around basic team structure &#8212; centralized? federated? centrally federated? &#8212; as companies scramble to determine how to set up their teams. It&#8217;s messy. It&#8217;s nuanced. It's fast-moving. Even for the best of companies, it&#8217;s a bit of a shit show. If your team is struggling, you&#8217;re not ...

**Published:** 2019-02-25T21:51:07+00:00

**Content Preview:**
Battle Royale has been one of the fastest growing trends of the past two years in gaming.&nbsp; PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds &nbsp;has been the main catalyst, wherein 100 players are pitted against each other on a large map with a single, simple objective: be the last person standing. An arsenal of weapons, equipment, and power-ups are scattered across the vast lands to help you achieve your goal. A lack of abilities and items that carry over from match to match help create a level playing field and a simple gameplay loop that doesn&#8217;t require vast amounts of time investment or in-depth knowledge of intricate mechanics. However, the explosive success of the genres has contributed to developers and gamers turning a blind eye to some of the factors that hinder the gameplay experience of most titles in the genre. Conflating this with the industry&#8217;s obsession to make everything a competitive eSport has resulted in a pattern of questionable design choices for both player and spectator alike. Random Factors There are a couple of random factors that come into play with many of the current Battle Royale games: The trajectory of the bus/plane/ship across the map at the start of the match, The distribution and variety of loot across the map, and The location of the safe area. These design choices help give games a rogue-like feel: randomization across these features keep the feeling new between rounds. It also rewards players who improvise and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the different tools at their disposal. But since most of these are a factor of luck, it means that even the best of players can be caught off-guard and be stuck in an impossible situation. Additionally, for spectators, it provides too much of an open-ended narrative and fails to create an engaging experience. Other competitive games that are watched by a broad audience have a rigid structure in how the game will be played that provide tension:&nbsp; League of Legends &nbsp;wil...

## Post 167: Why I Built an Open Source AEO Tool

**Publication:** Sarah's Newsletter
**Author:** Sarah Krasnik Bedell
**URL:** https://sarahsnewsletter.substack.com/p/why-i-built-an-open-source-aeo-tool
**Published:** 2025-07-23T14:02:12+00:00

**Content Preview:**
SEO is one part technical and one part content production; AEO (answer engine optimization) is much broader. LLMs serve up content from across the web, showing what content is considered high fidelity. To rank in ChatGPT&#8217;s answers, you have to have high web visibility, ie., good brand . Consider this web visibility view from Ahrefs. For example purposes, I&#8217;m comparing brands of a few of the AI tools. They're tracking mentions across the entire web &#8211; news sites, forums, social media, you name it. We see Cursor&#8217;s explosion in the market a few months ago, but ChatGPT remains more prominent today. This broadly maps to how these tools live in most people&#8217;s minds, just adds data to back it up. But here's the thing - web visibility is the means to the end. To improve it, you need to know exactly where to show up and what to talk about. That's where AEO tools should come in. Thanks for reading Sarah's Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. The AEO tooling landscape I evaluated seven different AI brand tracking tools (Ahrefs being one of them). The main issue I encountered with Ahrefs is that it searches the term, not the website. So, for a company with a common name like &#8220;Railway&#8221;, this wasn&#8217;t particularly helpful. There are many bespoke tools out there, but I selected a few from this list from Graphite . Many of them could tell me "you were mentioned 47 times this week in ChatGPT responses." However, I was fairly shocked to learn most tools don&#8217;t actually expose the websites used to cite your brand, when this is the most actionable piece! Note: there were a few that did include sources, but they were either 1) really expensive or 2) made me enter my own prompt topics as opposed to suggesting a few. Without the full citation source context, the data is colossally unactionable. Understanding the data isn&#8217;t enough to make it impactful - the tool must inform your marketing strategy. &...

I've been thinking a lot about SEO lately - it obviously affects AEO (Answer Engine Optimization), but the two are often conflated. More so, when does SEO actually make a business-changing impact? Here&#8217;s some rhetoric I&#8217;m seeing (exaggerated, sure, but paints the picture of directionally incorrect advice I&#8217;ve seen): SEO is always important SEO = AEO; they are one in the same Many efforts being lumped into the AEO umbrella Thanks for reading Sarah's Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Let's be Clear: AEO &#8800; SEO Before we dive into what actually works, let's untangle some confusing words. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) is bigger than SEO. Way bigger. Yes, SEO impacts AEO - if you rank well in search, you're more likely to show up in AI-generated answers. But that's just one piece. If you do the following, you&#8217;ll also show up in AI answers: Have a Reddit engagement strategy and execute on it Produce enterprise media reports Appear in dev blogs Be mentioned basically anywhere credible information lives online Example of citations from ChatGPT prompts, screenshotted from amionai.com. (Read: not traditional SEO) SEO for the last 20 years has been very Google-centric. As soon as AI chat enters the conversation (no pun intended), we have more ways to interact with information on the internet. Our pond just became an ocean. While SEO strategies help you rank for specific keywords and topics like &#8220;deploy PostgreSQL&#8221;, AEO determines whether you show up when someone asks ChatGPT "How would I deploy a PostgreSQL database?", with follow-up questions like &#8220;Is this the most cost-effective solution?&#8221;. The first is about keywords and page structure. The second is about being part of the broader conversation. There are many ways to be part of the broader conversation - whether it&#8217;s with the end user vs buyer, in earned media, on your own pages, on socials - the list goes on. One could arg...

## Post 169: Building a Repeatable Signal-Based Outbound Motion

**Publication:** Sarah's Newsletter
**Author:** Sarah Krasnik Bedell
**URL:** https://sarahsnewsletter.substack.com/p/building-a-repeatable-signal-based
**Published:** 2025-04-10T20:05:56+00:00

**Content Preview:**
If you&#8217;re reading similar content as I am, your LinkedIn feed is probably overflowing with posts about signal-based warm outbound. It's the current darling of the B2B SaaS world, promising to transform your outbound motion from cold calls into perfectly timed, personalized outreach that magically converts. However - there's a huge gap between the hype we all see and actually making this work in practice. After nine months of implementing signal-based outbound at Prefect using Common Room, I've seen the good, bad, and ugly of what really happens when you try to take the hype and make it reality. It&#8217;s messy but so, so fun. Here was our journey. Why Signal-Based Outbound Makes Sense for PLS Product-led growth (PLG) is all about positioning the product as the main driver for acquisition through monetization. But the reality is, not every product is perfectly suited for a pure PLG motion. Many companies are finding better success with a hybrid approach in product-led sales (PLS ). PLS acknowledges that while product usage can drive growth, strategic sales involvement helps accelerate conversion, especially for larger accounts. The challenge is identifying which self-serve users are genuinely sales-ready versus those needing more nurturing. That's where signal-based outbound becomes crucial. By capturing the signals potential ICPs leave across platforms, we can: Identify users showing genuine buying intent Engage them with personalized outreach at the perfect moment Nurture those not yet ready for sales conversations Build a repeatable, scalable outbound process that isn't just spray-and-pray The signal-based approach is particularly appealing for developer tool companies, especially those with open source products. OSS users are notoriously hard to identify, and show up in places far beyond the product itself. They are still - however - product users that could be in a buying cycle. Prefect&#8217;s OSS server usage grew exponentially since the launch of Prefe...

## Post 170: Marketing Attribution: A Guided Map for Success

If interested, find the recording of the talk below, initially prepared for PLGTM 2024 . Alright, let's dive into the world of marketing attribution - a topic that's often misunderstood but absolutely crucial for any marketer looking to make data-driven decisions. I recently gave a talk about this at PLGTM in San Francisco, and while the recording was lost into the ether, I'm excited to share these insights with you here. One key thing to remember as we go through this: implementation is 80% of the battle. This follows the classic 80/20 rule - you'll get 80% of the value from 20% of the effort. So don't get bogged down trying to create the perfect attribution system from day one. Start simple, and iterate. Thanks for reading Sarah's Newsletter! Subscribe to get more content like this. Why Attribution Matters Picture this: you're looking at a graph of user signups over time. There are spikes, there are dips, but what's causing them? That's where attribution comes in. It's all about explaining your growth and identifying those magical levers that drive conversions. Now, imagine that same graph, but with each spike color-coded to show its source. Suddenly, you can see that the big blue spike came from a webinar, while the brown spikes are from social media posts. At its core, marketing attribution allows you to understand conversion behavior and double down on what's working. But before we get into the nitty-gritty, let's bust some myths and share some tips to make your attribution journey smoother. Myth #1: Ad-blockers are the enemy You might think that with the rise of ad-blockers and privacy concerns, tracking user behavior is a lost cause. But here's the truth: cookies are changing, but they're not dead. And ad-blockers? They're not as widely used as you might think &#8211; even by developers! Let me share an experiment from our experience at Prefect. We compared our server-side signup data (the source of truth, in the database) with our client-side tracking data (...

Editorial note: it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve sent out a piece to you all. I&#8217;ve missed writing. My time has been deeply occupied by the many sweet marketing initiatives in the works at Prefect - one of which has been hiring. If interested in working with me and giving me the great gift of more time to write, check out the roles here . Today, I love webhooks. They provide a plug-and-play interface to the world of event-driven workflows, especially if you don&#8217;t have to host the infrastructure on which they run. From the sound of it, this setup could become completely unscalable from an engineering perspective. Trust me, I get it. I used to hate webhooks and found them extremely hard to manage during my time as a data engineer. You mean, triggering bespoke APIs from scattered sources without a real ability to run data quality checks, understand errors, retry failures, or encode dependencies? Thanks but no thanks. If a webhook was triggered with bad data, how could I figure out where that bad data came from? This seemed like a black hole of despair when it would inevitably come to debugging and scaling. So, when I say this admiration for webhooks was far from a predictable love story, I mean it. It was more analogous to the relationship between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds in The Proposal - an initial forced relationship that evolved into one I would never want to live without. Here&#8217;s my own rom-com-esque relationship with a piece of technology. What&#8217;s about to follow is a business user&#8217;s guide to webhooks used largely through a UI - not a deep engineering guide to self-hosting webhook infrastructure. This will be useful if you&#8217;re in ops, marketing, sales, and even analytics. Subscribe now Building context on webhooks Let&#8217;s start with the basics. I like this definition from Zapier: a webhook is a message sent programmatically when something happens. What is a webhook, at its most basic state? Webhooks have a few co...

Growth is all about experimentation. Reforge has a program about it, companies have been launched around it, and leaders talk about it . How do you actually implement a successful experiment? The questions already being discussed are how to: Decide which product feature should be behind a test Read the results of an A/B test Prioritize features based on data to have an educated hypothesis instead of finger-in-the-wind prioritization Imagine the point where the feature is almost implemented, you have a hypothesis, and are at the cliff of actually implementing the A/B test. How do you: Understand what parts of the test are in frontend vs. backend? Store who&#8217;s part of each group in the test? Make sure you implement a test that will have useful results at the end? Note: we&#8217;ll be talking about in-product tests where the user is logged in. Marketing tests are a separate can of worms which maybe we&#8217;ll open another day. Thanks for reading!

The frontend of a restaurant is what you see when you walk in (tables, food, drink, service) while the backend is behind the two swinging doors (kitchen, staff, supply chain for ingredients, management). Focusing on web applications, the frontend is what you see on your screen&#8212;the UI/UX. The backend powers this experience and usually consists of a set of APIs and databases. Similarly for experimentation, the frontend test elements are in the browser (UX or the cache), while the backend test elements are in the database. &#9654; Definition : A frontend test relies purely on the user experience and user groups can be defined in the browser cache; a backend test requires business logic and/or user assignment to be stored in the database. Test themselves aren&#8217;t necessarily only frontend or only backend&#8212;they can be both. Imagine ...

## Post 173: Guide to Anonymous Identity Resolution

**Publication:** Sarah's Newsletter

**Published:** 2023-08-15T15:22:00+00:00

**Content Preview:**
This article would not be possible without learning from Nicholas Brown, Jonathan Yu, and other fantastic engineers at Prefect while building our own internal identity resolution system with Amplitude for user attribution. I write this from a mixed perspective of a marketing, engineering, architecture design, and general analytics consumption. Web applications usually live across subdomains ( app.mycompany.io versus login.mycompany.io ) or even across completely different domains ( mycompany.io vs mycompany.com ). In theory, the user experience seamlessly transitions across the applications and sites with links and consistent branding. Not so hard to create a slick experience for the user yet, is it? Not so fast. What about triaging a support ticket for crashing documentation pages, or customizing user onboarding based on how they heard about your company? In both of these cases, you need to map unauthenticated data (documentation and website visits) to a specific user with an email and login. It gets even more blurry. Consider this: you built your product on app.mycompany.io, but finally got ownership of mycompany.com so the marketing site lives there. The documentation also lives where the marketing site is. The support ticketing system is completely separate and only requires a user&#8217;s email, not their potentially different username for the product login. Naturally, you don&#8217;t require users login to view documentation or the website. Core problem : personalizing user experience for efficient communication and support. Derived problem: having complete marketing and product data. Solution : identity resolution between anonymous and authenticated users. Steps of identity resolution First, whose identities are we resolving? Definition : An anonymous user is a web or app visitor that cannot be tied to self-identifying information. They haven&#8217;t provided it and it also cannot be logically deduced. Definition : An authenticated user is created from an ano...

This past year for me was an eventful learning experience and I&#8217;m so grateful for it. I&#8217;ve been a bit quiet lately, preparing for a few big changes coming up in 2023. So let&#8217;s dive right in. I&#8217;ll be a Vermonter! Source Starting in January, I&#8217;m relocating to&#8212;you read that right&#8212;the great green state of Vermont. New England is in my heart and soul, and I&#8217;m so excited to be that much closer to snow as we enter the best time of year: ski season. If anyone wants to wallow in what it was like to purchase a home in 2022, I&#8217;m there. Montreal &amp; Boston data communities: you&#8217;ll see me around next year! And for anyone in the Burlington area: let&#8217;s start a meetup. What about my tinkering? My policy has always been complete honesty, which is the main reason for sharing my ideas for improving the way SaaS tools are configured within marketing and sales teams. After talking to over 100 operators, the idea has transformed several times, with the goal remaining the same: reducing SaaS debt . It doesn&#8217;t take much to imagine the difficulty (financial, logistical, emotional) of purchasing a home and starting a company at the same time. This project is taking a bit of a back seat while I settle in to all of these exciting changes. To clarify, a back seat doesn&#8217;t mean not in the car. There&#8217;s so much to do when it comes to how marketing teams function, and I&#8217;m excited to chip away at this problem from a different angle (the exact angle has yet to be fully defined). Lastly, I spoke earlier this year about not having as tight knit marketing communities as we do in data. Since then, I&#8217;ve gotten recommendations on a few, including: MOPs Professionals, Lenny&#8217;s Community, and Reforge. There&#8217;s still so much more I can contribute here, but also punting this down the line in lieu of what&#8217;s to come. Up next: a new opportunity Source While I am still consulting (and probably always wi...

## Post 175: The Thrill of Deprecating Dashboards

**Content Preview:**
How many dashboards can one person reasonably gain insight from and act upon? While I don&#8217;t know the answer (this would actually be a great survey), I hope we can all agree the limit does exist. When we run before we walk and create a dashboard for every question asked without analyzing the question itself, that&#8217;s when dashboard bloat happens. Definition : Dashboard bloat is the effect on an organization when time is wasted finding the relevant visual to answer a question or recreating visuals that already exist. The cost in this case is time (and thus efficiency). When the holy grail Looker instance is poorly organized, the Head of Growth spends more time looking for that one useful graph on CAC segmented by paid versus free users than actually altering the growth strategy. If cleanliness and organization have already gone down the drain, the analytics team recreates visualizations that already exist. Dashboard bloat can be the result of a poorly implemented self-serve strategy or the direct antithesis of self-serve, depending on your viewpoint. Some have been saying dashboards aren&#8217;t the answer since 2013 , but coming up on 10 years later they&#8217;re as used as ever. While there certainly are new trends like data apps, automated insights, and operationalized data&#8212;dashboards aren&#8217;t going anywhere for a long time. Under the premise they&#8217;re here to stay&#8212;how do we organize them? Thanks for reading Sarah's Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Strategy paves the way forward They say startups win because they move fast, which is the case with analytics teams in startups as well. There is usually so much to do, so it&#8217;s hard to prioritize strategy over constant execution of everything and anything until tech debt is already there.

## Post 176: The Analytics Requirements Document

**Published:** 2022-10-27T15:32:06+00:00

**Content Preview:**
While I mentioned the Analytics Requirements Document (ARD) as a concept in a previous post , I really spoke about it in depth during a talk several weeks ago ( slides , recording ). The content from the talk has been transformed into this post and elaborated upon. The Head of Product at your e-commerce company comes to you, an analytics lead, and asks: &#8220;so when are we going to get performance metrics on that rewards program we launched last week?&#8221; You pretend you know what&#8217;s happening (there was a launch?) and say by end of the week you&#8217;ll have something (requirements might be complex, TBD). You fumbled through that one, but now the real work begins. Upon approaching your manager, the Head of Analytics, you figure out they knew about the new rewards program but didn&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s already out in the wild. The company does need to make a decision on whether to extend the rewards program to a broader set of users, though, so time is tight. Some cats get herded and you get some set of requirements around how to make that decision, requirements that may or may not make sense. Another week has gone by, but you can now start doing your job: delivering data around product launch metrics. Within 30 minutes of doing the actual work, alarm bells go off in your head. There&#8217;s a table listing rewards used on a particular day by a particular user, but rewards don&#8217;t tie back to items. You can&#8217;t actually know if users are building and using rewards points in a way that&#8217;a beneficial to the business (like making sure they&#8217;re not getting rewards for returned items). This probably sounds familiar, so let me be succinct with what&#8217;s to follow: this news gets back to the Head of Product and the CEO, both furious that two weeks are wasted on a product that can&#8217;t be measured. The data and product teams coordinate to actually generate useful data (you just need a foreign key on the item if it was purchased using r...

## Post 177: Choosing a Product Analytics Tool

**Published:** 2022-09-27T16:17:43+00:00

Last updated: 10/03/2022 Every company&#8217;s got users. And users do things on a site that a large team of engineers has been paid to build based on designs. How do you know if the designs implemented are actually good ? How do you know if all that time, money, and overall effort resulted in a product that is actually beneficial to the business? That&#8217;s product analytics : the discipline of understanding how users engage with your product. The &#8220;analytics&#8221; portion can contain a lot of different data, and that&#8217;s where confusion ensues. Mostly, it&#8217;s front-end tracking data &#8212;in short, tracking what pages users view and buttons they click. This will be the primary focus of this post. Why would you need product analytics, you might ask? Granular event tracking data can give you the following tidbits: Funnel analysis and drop-offs . Looking at percent of users that reach pages A, B, C, then D in a flow and comparing those percentages will show where users get stuck. If from page A 95% reach B, 90% reach C, but only 60% reach D, there&#8217;s clearly too much friction between pages C and D. Customized user experiences . A set of actions and then no conversion indicates a marketing opportunity. Consider a user that checked out an FAQ page about purchasing but didn&#8217;t purchase a product&#8212;if this event data lives in the marketing platform, automated campaigns can re-engage this user to potentially convert. Photo by Arno Senoner While some of this data might live in the existing production database that&#8217;s required to run any application, backend data doesn&#8217;t give the whole picture nor is it easily accessible to analytics and business teams. Customer data platforms (CDPs) claim to solve the accessibility problem. It&#8217;s a confusing term, I know. One way to define a CDP is a platform that centralizes user behavior (usually in the form of events) and sends it to other tools enabling customized user experiences. For ins...

## Post 178: What is SaaS Observability?

**Publication:** Sarah's Newsletter

**URL:** https://sarahsnewsletter.substack.com/p/what-is-saas-observability
**Published:** 2022-08-30T15:39:46+00:00

**Content Preview:**
Application observability is so mainstream that even finance junkies have a high level understanding of what application alerting is through NEWR (New Relic) and DDOG (DataDog) in the stock market. Analytics teams weren&#8217;t satisfied, though. Neither New Relic nor DataDog address data quality completely&#8212;cue the explosion of data observability tooling within the last couple years. And still, obvious errors make their way into customer-facing experiences. Consumers get emails starting with &#8220;Hello {first_name}&#8221;. While this situation is an unfortunate and blinding inconvenience, it gets much worse. Many Salesforce Administrators maintain lead scoring formulas to prioritize account executive time while maximizing revenue. A Salesforce lead scoring formula like CASE(LeadSource, "Organic", 2, "PaidAds", 1, 0) breaks when &#8220;Organic&#8221; changes to &#8220;Direct&#8221; and no one is notified, an error that is a direct hit on company financials. Consider organic traffic to be 30% of all leads and the most likely to convert into a sale; not reaching out to those leads first is at least a 30% hit to revenue if they are truly that efficient of leads. &#128587;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; Definition: SaaS Observability sheds light on the health of all data and automations in SaaS tools, allowing business teams to monitor, understand, and triage issues. Engineers get alerts when apps go down. Data teams get alerts when data doesn&#8217;t meet expectations. Why? Because they&#8217;ve been provided the tools to do so. Sales and Marketing Ops teams are misunderstood and only just beginning to get tech-forward tools to be maximally efficient. Arguably the most critical, business operations teams need to know when their automations aren&#8217;t working properly, even if the root cause is data itself.

## Post 179: Reinventing the Wheel of Data Activation

**Published:** 2022-07-26T17:22:48+00:00

**Content Preview:**
In our data bubble, we&#8217;ve been arguing about operational analytics, data activation, and warehouse-native apps. Let me summarize the conversation for you: after data gets to the warehouse, how should it get to its next destination? Some say it&#8217;s the warehouse vendor&#8217;s problem&#8212;Snowflake has stepped in here with their app development. Others say vertical vendors should step in like Supergrain , Pocus , or others to pull directly from the warehouse. Different viewpoints on these topics impact answers to the underlying questions: How will Snowflake/GCP/AWS continue to build on the apps framework to benefit the jobs of data teams? Will tools like Census/Hightouch become redundant or get bought out? To boil it down, all we are really doing is moving data around. That&#8217;s all we&#8217;re ever doing. Fivetran? Moving data. dbt? Moving data 1 . Difficulty in moving data increases as there&#8217;s just more data to move and more ways to use it once it gets to the destination. Activating data means allowing some tool to use data natively. Teams have been doing this for years whether we acknowledge it or not. Data activation &#8220;bells and whistles&#8221; Heard of Zapier , Make (formerly Integromat), or Workato ? They are in the business of activating data, even data that bypasses the warehouse. Any pipeline that doesn&#8217;t touch a database or warehouse can make us data people cringe&#8212;I&#8217;ll touch on this a bit later. First, let&#8217;s start with the basics. Both Zapier and Make have existed since 2011 and 2012, respectively. Zapier&#8217;s story is an interesting one , allowing all users to trigger data passing through APIs from one app to another in an intuitive platform. People latched on to this capability leading to their early profitability.

## Post 180: Hidden Tasks of Product Management

**Content Preview:**
Photo by Daria Nepriakhina on Unsplash Just like few graduate with a specific data engineering degree, no one graduates with a product management degree. To new graduates, the career path looks high leverage, high impact, and extremely strategic. While all that may be true, the path to a high impact product manager contains more than meets the eye. The most impactful people managers don&#8217;t simply tell their team what to do and leave it at that. They empower their team, follow up on progress, and validate approaches given their background and experience. Product managers should oversee their company&#8217;s offering (i.e. product) like any manager oversees people. Let&#8217;s start with the obvious: the job of a product manager is to make the company&#8217;s product better. Usually, the metrics by which the product is measured are established at the executive level. The &#8220;product&#8221; in this case can be however narrow or broad, depending on the product manager&#8217;s seniority. Using DoorDash as an example, one product manager (or team) could be responsible for any of the following: The core restaurant marketplace for consumers, measured by dollar amount of orders per month for volume or number of new users per month for growth. The dasher&#8217;s experience, measured by the number of orders completed per month for volume or number of new drivers per month for growth. DashPass, measured by monthly revenue for volume or number of new signups per month for growth. What&#8217;s obviously involved in oversight of any of these products is working closely with the engineering team to make sure scope of work is defined and timelines are met. If it were to just stop at that, you could easily call shipping a finicky un-measurable product a success. So what is there to do for PMs beyond strategic management? Hidden task #1: Being data-driven Product managers need to be data people , but are inherently biased towards showing the product under their purview working...

This week&#8217;s tone is a bit different. I started writing because I thought there should be more voices, more viewpoints, and more faces in the conversation. I don&#8217;t pretend I know everything, nor do I pretend my newsletter is the one stop shop for anything. I don&#8217;t write because it&#8217;s a money making machine. I write because it helps me organize my thoughts, get feedback, start conversations, but most importantly, it&#8217;s something I enjoy. Benn has called on his readers in a similar way. Pedram hinted at it in his latest post that wasn&#8217;t really about writing at all. But I&#8217;d like to make a call of my own: minority readers, you also have a voice. Of course, it&#8217;s much easier to make time for things that are part of your job, and for many of us, that isn&#8217;t writing. For the past 5 months, I&#8217;ve spent the first 45 minutes of every work day writing. It&#8217;s hard. But, if you&#8217;ve had the inkling and desire to start, what better time than now? At some point (maybe soon!), other projects might just get too top of mind for me to continue writing weekly. However, this is my promise: I will always write. Maybe not weekly, maybe not monthly, but the point is, I will always write. If you&#8217;d like feedback on a draft or to chat about writing, shoot me a message ....

This post is not a sponsored post. Note: I have advised Secoda mentioned in the article, but no vendor has pre-edited this content. In the 20th century, open floor plans took over first residential homes then slowly but surely office spaces . With a slow transition from boxed-off cubicles to open workspaces even most recently in FAANGs and the like, employees are encouraged to collaborate. In startup culture, collaboration comes naturally. If the number of employees is anywhere under 100, there&#8217;s usually only one or at most a small handful of people responsible for something. With remote work they&#8217;re not usually in the same building, but there&#8217;s fewer people to sift through. What happens when that number goes to 200 people, 500 people, or 1000+? Information naturally lives in people&#8217;s heads, and it takes extra effort to write it down on paper. I&#8217;ve personally tried to make documentation a habit but still slip up and forget. Documentation can live in so many different places: README&#8217;s on Github, Confluence, Notion, Google Docs, just to name a few. However, each of these are optimized for their own category of documentation: Github for code, Confluence and Notion for docs and diagramming. None of them are optimized for data. What documentation means for analytics Not being optimized for data means: table documentation quickly becomes stale as new columns are added to the source; data quality isn&#8217;t even part of the conversation; there&#8217;s no obvious connection between data, business concepts, and BI. Onboarding a single tool to tie together all different sorts of data allows teams in larger organizations speak the same language without relying on communication over Slack. A tool will never be the full solution &#8212;someone has to own it and others have to use it. Documentation coming from analytics teams must enable anyone to quickly find and understand any data asset they&#8217;re looking for to deliver value. This inclu...

Operational teams are the backbone of any organization. The work that happens behind the scenes isn&#8217;t talked about enough. Without operations, each team that it supports wouldn&#8217;t be as efficient. Who wouldn&#8217;t strive for efficiency? It&#8217;s doing the same task, with the same quality and scale, just faster. Operations teams support other departments in doing exactly that by using the best tools, automations, and processes out there. Efficiency is an operations team&#8217;s goal. Yet, they are still largely misunderstood. They are not the teams that just get pawned the manual work or simply do the mundane tasks. If that&#8217;s the case, their potential is being wasted. So how can we set up operational teams for success? The evolution of support functions Consider the profession of a phone operator. Today, phone support means one of two things. First, you could be calling a vendor for support because you need help. Maybe you need to initiate a return of clothing, close your account, you name it. Someone might answer the phone, walk you through some instructions, and tell you you&#8217;re all set. Second, you could be having an issue with your physical phone and need tech support. Maybe you spilled coffee on it, maybe it stopped charging. In any case, that&#8217;s not what phone support always meant. For most of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of people were employed as telephone operators to route calls from source to destination. With the evolution of switchboards, this functionality became automated and their skills were needed on either more personalized support calls or in technical jobs. While some may see the history of the telephone operator to be a rise and fall, I see it as an evolution. With technical progress, people are employed to do less repetitive work. Operational functions evolve as tools evolve. A deep dive: types of operational teams I&#8217;m likely only hitting a small portion of the types of operational teams out there...

## Post 184: Modernity != Value

**Published:** 2022-04-19T16:40:43+00:00

**Content Preview:**
I really dislike the term &#8220;Modern Data Stack&#8221;. This focus on modernity has taken us further away from the reason behind using certain tools in the first place. Adopting a particular tool doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s used in the intended way. You can use Census/Hightouch to write raw data into a Google Sheet or to some other Postgres database for stakeholders to manipulate themselves (read: not a great approach). Having multiple dbt repos across a 1000+ person organization will likely result in duplicate models even though there are 3 separate teams of 10 analytics engineers being paid to model data. Oh and metrics&#8212;just because a metrics layer exists doesn&#8217;t mean the metric definitions are agreed upon and communicated across the entire company. It doesn&#8217;t matter what tools we use&#8212;what matters is how analytics teams can influence the trajectory of their respective organizations. Some tools considered to be part of the modern data stack make delivering this value easier, sure, but aren&#8217;t the end-all be-all. So how do analytics teams actually drive change at an organizational level? Back to first principles: delivering value Analytics teams aren&#8217;t there to build data platforms. Sure, it&#8217;s what they do, but it&#8217;s not their reason for being . Outside of data professionals, I fundamentally don&#8217;t think other teams should care what tools are used. Why would a sales professional care if they&#8217;re getting Tableau or Looker dashboards emailed to them? Not caring does not mean lack of curiosity. Should data teams educate other teams how they work? Sure. Can those other teams function just the same without this information? I&#8217;d argue yes. Taking a snippet from MongoDB &#8217;s definition, a data platform &#8220;enables the acquisition, storage, preparation, delivery, and governance of your data, as well as a security layer for users and applications&#8221; and is the &#8220;key to unlocking the value of y...

Before thinking about PMF, devtool vendors first have to: understand the audience, source leads by appealing to said audience, onboard them to the particular tool, and only then can vendors think about retention. This is largely encompassed by the developer experience function with a sprinkle of marketing and growth. Where do vendors start with the goal of getting people hooked? Don&#8217;t build toys, solve problems Photo by Crissy Jarvis If I, a potential customer, read a marketing page explaining how the product is built or a detailed rendition of what it does, I usually move on quickly. It begs the question, so what? Why should I pay money for this? Every real problem can be boiled down to either saving time or money. Rolled out a change with a mistake because there wasn&#8217;t any testing? It&#8217;s either going to cost the business money because the product isn&#8217;t functioning properly or waste a developer&#8217;s time fixing the issue&#8212;time that could&#8217;ve been spent doing something more productive had the mistake not occurred in the first place. Can&#8217;t use Python easily in a workflow that&#8217;s built for SQL? Workarounds make a task take longer than it needs to if there was only the right tooling, again coming down to wasting precious development time. At the end of the day, development time is money&#8212;engineers don&#8217;t work for free.

I don&#8217;t want to live and think in a vacuum, and actively try not to. Listening is my biggest key to inspiration. A few people have asked about what blogs and podcasts I soak in, so here it goes. Blogs Two newsletters come to mind as always being in the conversation within the analytics engineering community: Benn&#8217;s Substack: Out of the box opinions (like on Excel) and comments on data news (like Snowflake&#8217;s acquisition of Streamlit). Analytics Engineering Roundup (by dbt Labs): Weekly summary of hot takes from dbt Slack. There are several other individuals whose writing particularly speaks to me, and I often find myself going back over and over again to their work: Technically : Written by @itunpredictable , each article is a step-by-step breakdown of a single technical concept. My latest favorite is the overview of GraphQL . Lenny&#8217;s Newsletter : Everything product and community, from what it takes to be a PM to how popular apps got their first 1000 users. Data Operations : Data operations might mean different things to different people, but to Greg Meyer it&#8217;s bringing a programmers mindset to various areas of business. Data People Etc : Stephen Bailey unpacks the hard conversations that all analytics teams struggle with, like what a source of truth really means at different stages of an organization. Digital Native : Consumer, tech, and beyond. A stew of different topics, all backed by data. For example, here Rex goes into growth trajectories of startups in fields from climate to finance. Part of listening is staying in the loop, both on data news, conferences, funding, and VC chatter. For venture news, I try to keep up with: Data Council Newsletter: Even though I wasn&#8217;t able to make the Data Council Conference in Austin this year, I can certainly tell that many data startups begin the conversation within the Data Council sphere. ffVC Newsletter: A weekly rundown of resources, reads, and threads that appeal to folks in VC.

## Post 187: AI and neuroscience

Like many of you I&#8217;ve been watching (listening to?) a lot of the Dwarkesh podcast over the past 6 months, and one theme that seems to come up a lot is the relationship between AI and the brain . The way we train and use GenAI models today strongly resembles how the pathways in the human brain actually work; and many neuroscientists and AI researchers believe the key to unlocking real superintelligence will lie in our ability to better understand and exploit that connection. This post is going to explore a few ways in which this is true and explain some of these rather complicated ideas in more simple language. Neural networks, the basis for everything The obvious place to start is neural networks , the architecture for pretty much all of the AI models that you use today like the GPT family, Claude, Nano Banana, and the like. Obviously the first word &#8211; neural &#8211; likens these models to the animal brain. The human brain has something in the range of 86B neurons, which are specialized cells that transmit nerve impulses; essentially the core unit of how our brains transmit information and signals. The idea is that neural networks work in kind of the same way. And indeed, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find an explanation of neural networks that doesn&#8217;t make an analogy to the human brain. Take, for example, Technically&#8217;s very own breakdown of neurons from the prolific Nicole Errera: Neurons are the basic building blocks of AI architectures, modeled after the actual biological neurons that transmit signals throughout the human brain. Remember, AI models are essentially pattern investigators; they find the underlying pattern in the data. You can think of these neurons as the mathematical functions that are doing this hard investigative work, getting into the weeds of the data and figuring out what&#8217;s going on. The math performed by individual neurons is actually pretty simple &#8211; it&#8217;s usually just basic multiplication and addition...

Hello distinguished Technically readers, My sources tell me it&#8217;s not too late to say happy new year . 2025 was the year everyone started to use AI at work. 2026 is the year we figure out how to get the most out of it, vibe code things that actually work, and steer clear of hallucinations (unless you&#8217;re into that kind of thing, in which case you might get oneshotted by ayahuasca). So here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been up to for the past month. New on Technically 2026 vibe coding tool comparison Available as a free post on Substack (courtesy of Vercel) and now in its permanent home in the AI, it&#8217;s not that Complicated knowledge base. All hail vibe coding, savior of the Ideas Guy. But which vibe coding tool should you use? I tested 4 of the most popular options by building the same app on each: an internal dashboard for Vandelay Industries&#8217; potato chip import/export operations. For each I cover how well they work, any quirks to watch out for, plus pricing and how far you can get on a free plan. The AI user&#8217;s guide to evals Available as a paid preview on Substack , and now in its permanent home in the AI, it&#8217;s not that Complicated knowledge base. As non-technical people build more and more stuff with AI they are starting to run into the same issues as software engineers &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to know when things are working or not. This guide to evals gives you the background you need to start adding effective monitoring to your AI system. Based on my conversation with eval expert Hamel Husain, this post covers: Why evals matter: moving from &#8220;I think the bot is getting better&#8221; to &#8220;hallucination rate dropped from 15% to 3% this week&#8221; Look at the data: why you need to examine your failures before writing fancy tests Assertions over LLM judges: why simple keyword checks beat complex AI-judging-AI setups A practical 4-step workflow: vibe check, spreadsheet, simple fixes, then targeted evals This one is pretty prac...

What do you buy for that special engineer in your life who requires everything &#8211; from her mechanical keyboard to her espresso machine &#8211; to be just so ? Or perhaps you&#8217;ve had a good year, and want to get a little something for yourself, as a treat? They told me not to write this. They said &#8220;stay in your lane, Justin.&#8221; You just explain technical things, you can&#8217;t recommend gifts. You don&#8217;t know how to reach the hearts of loved ones. Well, I&#8217;ll be DAMNED if I don&#8217;t try! By the way, I&#8217;m taking the last two weeks of the year off to go cook in a restaurant (literally), so Technically will be offline. I know it will be difficult to soldier on without my sweet voice hitting your inbox every week with technical explainers&#8230;but I have confidence in you. Without further ado&#8230; The Ohto CR02 Yea, I can type, but sometimes I like writing things down the old fashioned way. And nobody is better at crafting the instruments to do so than the Japanese. I tested 4 different Ohto pens and the CR02 was my favorite after a few days of furious scribbling. It&#8217;s a ceramic rollerball, so it glides across the page. And at 0.5mm it&#8217;s the perfect thinness for my dainty preferences. Price: $16 The Orbit Plus Turntable It probably doesn&#8217;t surprise you that I&#8217;m a jazz guy (I even play drums occasionally). And the genre is best appreciated on vinyl for reasons that are set in the cosmos. Orbit makes affordable and high quality turntables that look great and are assembled in the USA. I&#8217;d recommend going for the Plus , which for an extra $150 gets you a much better cartridge. Pictured: my setup at home If you already have speakers, great. If you don&#8217;t I can highly recommend the Kanto YU4 alongside their SUB6 subwoofer . They&#8217;re reasonably priced, sound great, and have a built in preamp plus bluetooth so you can stream from your devices if you so desire. Price: $399 The Salomon XT-6 If you li...

It&#8217;s widely understood that the holidays is about family, but of what use are they if they&#8217;re constantly holding you back from your professional goals? Here at Technically, we believe that the holidays is about the grind &#8212; you&#8217;ve finally broken free from being the idea guy on the business side. As Charlie Parker said, &#8220;now is the time&#8221; &#8212; get out the laptop, heat up a hot pocket, and prompt away. The holidays are for vibe coding. Idea people thrive in the holidays. Let&#8217;s dive in. &#8212; It&#8217;s nearing 2026, and you (probably) don&#8217;t need a software engineer to build the app of your dreams. I tested 4 of the most popular vibe coding tools to see which was the best. TL;DR: Replit was the most feature rich, well thought out, and powerful v0 was the best if you&#8217;re already a developer and want a technical interface Lovable and Bolt were pretty much objectively worse than the other two Most importantly, I believe that the initial app building phase in vibe coding is largely commoditized across tools, and what makes any platform a better fit than another is largely pricing models and integrations . In this post I&#8217;ll walk through my experience with each of these tools, covering: How they work, and important differentiating features Pricing, tokens , and how far you can get on a free plan (I paid for 2/4) How good (or bad) they are at fixing bugs Throughout I&#8217;ll be using a very serious, very real set of prompts. As Art Vandelay, owner and CEO of Vandelay Industries, my team needs an internal dashboard to handle the importing and exporting of potato chips to the United States. Here&#8217;s the prompt I started each tool out with: I am the CEO of Vandelay Industries, a global firm that handles the importing and exporting of potato chips to the United States. I need to build an app for managing the internal operations of my business. The app should have 3 main views: 1) An inventory manager / CRM of all ...

Like you, I&#8217;m extremely tired of the recurring headlines about &#8220;AI replacing the workforce,&#8221; written almost exclusively by people who both know nothing about AI and have never been part of said workforce. Ironic. Let me start by saying that I do not think AI is going to put massive swaths of people out of work. But that&#8217;s only going to be true as long as we are smart, adaptive, and embrace these new tools to make us all more productive and more creative. The problem is that there are tons of lazy people out there who are using AI completely carelessly, with such minimal oversight such that they are essentially writing their own pinkslips. If you carelessly offload the core and soul of your job to AI, you cannot be surprised when someone decides AI can do it instead of you. If you are a software engineer for whom Cursor now writes all of your code with minimal oversight or creative input from you, this is bad. If you are a marketer who is generating entire blog posts and page sites with vanilla Claude prompts, this is bad. If you are an SDR who has ChatGPT write all of your outbound emails with no customization whatsoever, this is bad. At some point, your boss is going to realize that the AI is doing your job, not you. The brain drain from junior talent and financial modeling I see this pattern with more junior people the most. They are at a point in their careers where they have minimal experience and maybe more importantly minimal taste. The risk of overusing AI is huge here, because without going through the motions and developing that earned intuition for the mechanics of your work, you will never develop that taste. IMO at the highest levels, you are paid for exactly this. I was talking to my friend CJ of the wonderful Mostly Metrics newsletter about how this manifests itself in finance. A lot of what finance teams at startups do is build financial models, which as any investment bankers in the audience can tell you, is something with a l...

Hello distinguished Technically readers, In 2017 I was traveling with Winston Churchill across the scantly-visited regions of southern Tibet when we came across a peculiar guru. I spent months learning at his hip, observing his peculiarities, and gathering bits and pieces of his doctrine. All of this I would eventually publish in my acclaimed 2017 paper , &#8220;Attention is all you need.&#8221; Continuing on my research, you won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that we published a lot about AI this month: all about RLHF, why Microsoft is reviving an old nuclear power plant to build data centers, and why starting with small, manual tasks is the best way to get yourself started with AI at work. We&#8217;ve also been building something bigger behind the scenes to make all of this easier to learn. More on that later! Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new: New on Technically What&#8217;s RLHF? Available as a paid preview on Substack , and now in its permanent home in the AI, it&#8217;s not that complicated knowledge base. Though much of the effort and compute for training AI models goes into pre-training, you might be surprised to hear that pre-trained models are kind of dumb. They&#8217;re like a precocious toddler: ask them a simple question and you&#8217;ll get a long winded, disorganized, and poorly vetted response. This post explains the three-step process that fixed this, and enabled today&#8217;s models like Claude: Supervised fine-tuning teaches models the format of helpful answers How building a reward model trains an AI to judge responses like a human would (because paying humans to score millions of examples is impossibly expensive) Reinforcement learning lets models generate millions of responses and learn which ones score highest RLHF is basically a finishing school for AI &#8211; teaching it manners, helping it read the room, and turning raw intelligence into something you&#8217;d actually want to work with.

TL;DR : we&#8217;re announcing the AI Reference , the best, fastest, and free-est way to get smart on the fundamentals behind AI models like RAG, RLHF, context, and pre-training. It&#8217;s totally free and you can dive in here . 90s kids will without a doubt remember these: Behold, the Magic Eight Ball&#8482;. The eight ball was an answer machine. You&#8217;d ask a question, turn over the eight ball, and get a random response. Don&#8217;t count on it . My sources say no . It is decidedly so. Signs point to yes! Trying to decide if you should call her? Ask the eight ball. Wondering if you&#8217;ll ever get that job interview? Eight ball. Unsure about which college you should go to? You should probably ask your advi&#8230;nope, eight ball. This plastic orb of whimsical wonder was the oracle of an entire generation &#8211; my generation &#8211; injecting a little random levity into what was an uncertain time in life for many of us. The idea and technology behind the eight ball were originally created by Albert C. Carter in the mid 1940s. Inspired by his clairvoyant mother, Carter patented (yes) a series of crystal ball like fortune telling devices, all of which went nowhere. That was until 1950, when Chicago&#8217;s Brunswick Billiards Company was looking for a promotional toy of sorts&#8230;and the rest was history. (Abe Bookman was Carter&#8217;s brother-in-law, who helped him file more patents and manufacture the thing) The way it works is simple. Inside the eight ball lies a canister full of dark blue liquid, in which is suspended a plastic multi-faceted die (usually 20 sides). When you turn over 1 the eight ball, the die floats up and lands on one side, showing you a decidedly random message. The visage became so popular that it even made its way into high fashion, if you can call it that. All signs point to yes! The thing about the eight ball is that it&#8217;s fun . Like opening a fortune cookie and peeking inside at the little white flag, you couldn&#8217;t he...

The TL;DR The Scaling Law rules everything: The smartest people in the room believe that if we just throw more computers at AI, it keeps getting smarter. There is no ceiling yet. More compute means more data centers : scaling up compute means running more, larger CPUs and GPUs in more, larger data centers across the world. But the grid can&#8217;t support these DCs: The U.S. power grid was built for a world of lightbulbs and TVs, not for millions of H100 GPUs running 24/7. We are running out of supply. The nuclear option: Big Tech (Microsoft, Google, Amazon) is literally buying nuclear power plants because wind and solar aren&#8217;t reliable enough to keep the AI brain alive. The supply chain of intelligence: Everyone who matters in AI is signing huge contracts to build out more data centers and power: AI labs ( OpenAI ), cloud providers (Microsoft/Azure), and energy companies. I&#8217;m in my 30s now, so it won&#8217;t surprise you to hear that I&#8217;ve been listening to a bunch of Sarah Paine lectures about World War II recently. One of the themes I keep coming back to is the major (even primary) role that resources play in large scale conflicts: the U.S. industrial output (and to a lesser extent, The Allies&#8217;) was simply far superior to The Axis and that&#8217;s a big reason that we won. It&#8217;s not just the weapons and the soldiers that fight wars; it&#8217;s all of the enabling infrastructure that supports them. I mention this because the same exact thing is true in AI, which some (not me) are starting to talk about as a type of war itself. Much of the focus in AI is on state of the art model capabilities and whatever the newest frontier model can do. But equally important is all of the infrastructure that goes into creating and running those models. The market knows this, because it thinks NVIDIA is the most valuable company in the world. And it seems like every day OpenAI is signing yet another obscure deal with a cloud provider, chip maker, or dat...

How do you make sure they actually work? If you&#8217;ve banged your head against the table trying to get Claude or ChatGPT to write a better email or properly summarize your test results, you already know the answer: better prompts. The more data you include and the clearer your instruction, the closer the model response is going to be to what you want. In practice, that means a bunch of back and forth between you and the model until you&#8217;re happy; it&#8217;s an iterative process that in some senses is never finished. But if you&#8217;re a developer building AI models into your app &#8211; and they&#8217;re going to be used by tons of users around the globe &#8211; things are a little more complicated. For apps that go big, you could have millions of users interacting with these models every day. At this kind of scale, you can&#8217;t just prompt, hope for the best, and then wait to see what happens &#8211; you risk weird, incorrect, or downright dangerous responses to your users. This is where evals come in. They help companies continuously improve the performance of the models in their products via a feedback loop of monitoring and scoring.

So you sat down and vibe coded an app that you&#8217;ve wanted to build for a while. Like magic, you prompted a model (maybe it was in a product like v0 ) and the app of your dreams appeared. The obvious question is&#8230;now what? What is your app, exactly? And how do you make sure it works fast and smooth? This is the vibe coder&#8217;s guide to real coding. I&#8217;m going to run through the 5 most important things to know about the app you&#8217;ve built so you can take it to the moon&#8230;or just avoid getting hacked. 1) All about servers and the cloud: where your app is running (or needs to run) When you build an app from scratch, one of the things you need to worry about is distribution &#8211; how do you get it running on a server somewhere so everyone can access it? Today, most developers have a two step process for building their apps: First, they build the app locally : on their laptops or desktops. All of the code runs on your computer, and nobody else can access it. Think of it like your personal sandbox. Once the app is ready, it gets deployed to the cloud : big, rented servers. Via these, users (hopefully many of them) access the app over the internet. This is the world of cloud infrastructure . You&#8217;ve probably heard of the big dogs &#8211; AWS , GCP, and Azure &#8211; and maybe even smaller managed service providers like Heroku . There really are a million ways to get your app in the cloud today. The important thing to know is that apps have to run somewhere; and where and how you choose to run them have major impacts on how they perform. If you built an app using something like v0 or Lovable , this step of the equation is already taken care of for you. v0 gives you a one click option to deploy your app to Vercel &#8217;s cloud; all you do is click deploy and you get a URL. But if you used something like Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or even regular old Claude or ChatGPT , you might need some help turning that app into something everyone can use....

At the time they had one focus, and they did it really well: making it easy for engineers to deploy their frontends , or the user-facing parts of their applications. In fact the award-winning 1 Technically website runs on Vercel . But since then, a lot has changed. The world has been taken over by AI (figuratively, if anyone from the future is reading this). The way people build their apps is drastically different than it was just a few short years ago. And to match, Vercel has built a bunch of really interesting new products that are getting traction fast. This post is going to talk about those products, what makes them interesting, and why you should care about them. Because I do! How building AI apps is different from building app apps If you asked a developer 5 years ago what it means to &#8220;build AI into your app&#8221; they&#8217;d probably have looked at you funny. At the cutting edge there were some people using what we then called Machine Learning to personalize some product experiences or provide some basic data-related suggestions.

Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new in our AI, it&#8217;s not that complicated knowledge base: A walkthrough of hallucinations , why models make things up, and what anyone can do about it An deep dive on MCP , why it&#8217;s been so painful to use, and how FastMCP makes it work in practice A look at the scaling law driving the AI arms race, and what it means for the future of the industry New on Technically Why do models hallucinate? Available as a paid preview on Substack , and now in its permanent home in the AI, it&#8217;s not that complicated knowledge base. Guest-written by Nicole Errera. Since the dawn of time, humans have seeked hallucination&#8212;often via psychedelic drugs&#8212;as a means to connect with God, or at least the one that lives within their hearts. Believe it or not, AI models seem to be doing the same. Kind of. Hallucination is the term researchers use when AI confidently generates information that&#8217;s wrong, misleading, or completely fabricated. One infamous example: a lawyer who cited fake court cases after relying on ChatGPT . But guess what&#8230; this isn&#8217;t really a glitch. It&#8217;s a built-in feature of how these systems work. This explainer covers: The root causes of hallucination (training data issues, but also just statistical prediction) Why models would rather guess than admit ignorance Techniques like RLHF, RAG, and chain-of-thought that help reduce the problem Practical steps to avoid getting burned by AI-generated fiction The takeaway: these models are really good at word prediction, not truth-telling per se. How can you make MCP actually work in production? Filed under the AI, it&#8217;s not that complicated knowledge base and available as a free post on Substack , thanks to Prefect .

## Post 200: A deep dive into MCP and its associated servers

&#8220;Everybody only wants to dis-cuss me&#8221; &#8211; Eminem, likely referring to eMCeePee servers Since we covered the basics of MCP a few months ago, it feels like things have only gotten more chaotic. Adoption has been steadily growing, more and more companies seem to release MCP servers by the week, and (perhaps most importantly) both OpenAI and Google announced they&#8217;d support the standard. Ever so strong have my feelings been that this little corner of the AI world is due for a deep dive. Let us begin. Thanks to Prefect Technologies for sponsoring this post . Recap: what MCP is and why you should care about it MCP solves a simple problem: it allows AI models to communicate with external systems and tools in a standardized way. The TL;DR from my first post: The Model Context Protocol helps models like Claude talk and work with external systems in a standardized way. AI models today struggle mightily with accessing external data from the tools you use every day The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI models to talk to external systems like databases, Google Maps, and more Via MCP, models can pull data from these systems, or even take action in them (like sending an email) Providers need to build MCP servers that allow models to integrate with their systems Outside of new OpenAI and Google models coming online, for the most part, the &#8220;client&#8221; part of the equation &#8211; these are the models that can hook into MCP &#8211; hasn&#8217;t changed since MCP was released. It is the server side of the equation that has seen the most action, in the form of companies of all shapes and sizes building and releasing their own MCP servers . They do this because they want more people using AI models to be able to use their tools via those AI models. This is actually how MCP came to be in the first place. It wasn&#8217;t part of some big company-wide strategy. The creators of MCP &#8211; David Parra and Justin Spahr-Summers (no relation) &#8...

## Post 201: Why do models hallucinate?

**Author:** Nicole Errera

**Published:** 2025-09-09T12:12:23+00:00

**Content Preview:**
TL;DR Model hallucination is what researchers call it when AI models make stuff up This can lead to widespread misinformation, poor decision-making, and even psychological harm for users Hallucinations happen when models are fed bad training data&#8230;but they&#8217;re also part and parcel of how AI works Researchers are working on some promising methods to reduce hallucination Remember the early days of ChatGPT , when screenshots like this one were making the rounds on Twitter? This is a classic example of model hallucination , a term for when AI generates content that is factually inaccurate , misleading , or illogical . Hallucinations in language models can manifest as anything from arithmetic errors to false claims about history to declaring love for a human user (I&#8217;m looking at you, Sydney Bing ). And because today&#8217;s models are so good at stringing words together, hallucinated content can often seem plausible at first glance. For reasons I&#8217;ll explain in this post, hallucinations aren&#8217;t just &#8220;a side effect to be fixed&#8221;&#8212;they are pretty integral to how AI works. Some tech executives say that hallucination actually adds value to AI systems, by representing existing information in new and creative ways. But the phenomenon can also have serious repercussions. Like that one time a lawyer used ChatGPT and ended up citing fake cases in court. Yikes. Does this mean you should avoid using AI tools altogether? Of course not&#8212;or this post would be a whole lot shorter. There are still tons of useful applications of generative AI tools, like to help you summarize a meeting transcript or brainstorm project titles. The key is figuring out how to use these tools responsibly, before they land you on the front page of Forbes (for the wrong reasons). What causes hallucination? So why do AI models hallucinate, anyway? Let&#8217;s take a step back. Language models work by analyzing a long chain of words and predicting the next word in t...

## Post 203: Databricks is apparently worth $100B. What do they even do?

**URL:** https://read.technically.dev/p/databricks-is-apparently-worth-100b
**Published:** 2025-08-25T16:02:48+00:00

**Content Preview:**
If you&#8217;re like me, you are probably a little bit confused about Databricks . To the innocent onlooker, it sometimes feels like they are constantly announcing some new fundraising round, multiple times per year, each with a comically larger valuation than the next. Their most recent of these comically large valuations is $100B (yes, one hundred billion), making them one of the 5 most valuable private companies in the world. At this point, Databricks has raised so many funding rounds that they are running out of letters in the alphabet to designate them (this is their Series K, by the way). All of this begs the obvious question. What does Databricks actually do? It&#8217;s not like their website headline clears things up at all. Why are there three periods in the headline, but no period after the subhead? What is a data intelligence platform? Judging by the imagery, you&#8217;d be justified to believe Databricks somehow got a $100B valuation by selling these: The magic eight ball says: Don&#8217;t count on it. I first wrote about this frankly very odd company back in 2020, when they were only worth a paltry $6B. Here&#8217;s the TL;DR that I put atop the post: Databricks sells a data science and analytics platform &#8211; i.e., a place to query and share data &#8211; built on top of an open source package called Apache Spark. Apache Spark is an open source engine for running analytics and machine learning across distributed, giant datasets Spark is notoriously hard to run on your own infrastructure, and companies often don&#8217;t have the expertise to do that Databricks provides a managed service for running Spark clusters , as well as notebooks for visualization and exploration, plus the ability to schedule pipelines More recently, Databricks has been expanding the product portfolio to include ML and data warehousing This is a pretty big company, all things considered - $6.2B was their most recent valuation , and they&#8217;re planning on going public in 2021....

## Post 204: What's documentation?

**Publication:** Technically
**Author:** Justin
**URL:** https://read.technically.dev/p/whats-documentation
**Published:** 2025-08-19T12:12:26+00:00

**Content Preview:**
The TL;DR Documentation explains how to use your product and all of the things it can (and cannot) do. Documentation is like a manual for your product , explaining how to do anything you&#8217;d need to do Products built for developers tend to be less visual and more complex than the norm; users expect high quality documentation Actually writing and maintaining docs tends to be a headache for engineering teams Products like GitBook help offload that headache via a classy publishing experience Documentation isn&#8217;t just for developers anymore, and it isn&#8217;t just a product thing. As products get more and more complex, teams across the board are building impressive documentation programs to show off what they&#8217;ve built. Why we need documentation in the first place There&#8217;s an old adage attributed to Steve Jobs 1 that goes something like: &#8220;If the product needs a manual, the design has failed.&#8221; The idea is that your product should be intuitive, and if you need to explain how to use it, you&#8217;ve already lost. Now I&#8217;m no product design expert, but I can tell you for sure that just about every software product in the world has ignored this advice. Products have never been as feature rich and complicated as they are today&#8230;and thus we require a bit of guidance to navigate them. Just think about how many settings are in Gmail, how many functions are in Excel, and how many keyboard shortcuts there are in Discord. Obviously, they need to be written down somewhere . And nowhere is this more true than developer tools and infrastructure . Because most products built for developers are not visual &#8211; they make use of code editors and the Terminal . They&#8217;re API s and SDKs, libraries and frameworks . How are you supposed to know which API endpoints you can make requests to? What data do you need to include with your request? And what data can you expect to be returned? What does it mean when you get a specific error code? The an...

Let&#8217;s give a warm welcome to Nicole, our newest correspondent at Technically. Nicole studied Computer Science at Duke with a concentration in AI, led cutting edge research at a robotics lab on campus, and will be writing deep dives on how AI works. - Justin TL;DR Architectures are the blueprints for AI models: they dictate how models are designed and built Most AI today is made up of computing units called neurons linked together in complex networks There are a million ways to build these networks: different algorithms, structures, and sizes Researchers match different architectures to the specific problems and data constraints they face Have you ever wondered how AI models get designed? Or what makes a Large Language Model like the one behind ChatGPT different from a Computer Vision model used for self-driving cars? Isn&#8217;t it all just AI under the hood? The answer boils down to model architecture . Architectures are the blueprints of AI models &#8211; they are the sum of all the decisions whoever is building the model makes about what algorithms, data, sizes, and other stuff goes into said model. There are tons and tons of ways to build an AI model: a particular architecture just chooses one (or multiple, but more on that later). Picking the right architecture for your domain is really important. The basic 101 tagline for how AI models get built goes something like, &#8220;AI uses really complicated math to learn patterns from really large quantities of data.&#8221; This explanation isn&#8217;t wrong, but it&#8217;s only half the story. The other half? Smart architecture design . To understand model architectures and how they work, we have to start with the neuron &#8211; the building block of every advanced AI model out there today. This post will explain what a neuron is and how researchers and engineers piece these neurons together to build complex systems capable of incredibly challenging tasks.

Hello illustrious Technically readers, This is the fourth ever Technically Monthly, and it&#8217;s a&#8230;well, it&#8217;s actually a pretty normal one. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new: 2 new explainers: one on how generative models actually work, and one on why GPUs are the backbone of modern AI A simple guide to JavaScript, the most popular programming language in the world A foundational term worth revisiting: the CPU (especially now that we&#8217;ve covered GPUs) New on Technically The post about GPUs Available as a paid preview on Substack , and now in its permanent home in the AI, it&#8217;s not that Complicated knowledge base. A smart English man once argued that our entire economy is dependent on mega companies spending hundreds of billions a year on buying GPUs from another mega company (NVIDIA). A less smart American man (me) will explain to you what these GPUs actually are, how they work, and why people seem to be throwing money at them to train huge AI models. This post explains: The difference between CPUs and GPUs What makes GPUs so well-suited for running billions of simple operations at once Why training and running GenAI models is a great fit for GPUs in particular I also (lightly) touch (tap?) on the growing demand for AI chips, why supply is so tight, and what alternatives like Groq and TPUs are bringing to the table. What is JavaScript? Available free to all readers, and now in its forever home in the Building Software Products knowledge base. Here&#8217;s a sentence nobody would have believed 10 years ago. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world! And not without controversy, because it&#8217;s also one of the weirdest and most inconsistent ones. This post traces how JS got so popular, from humble beginnings in the 90s to powering full web apps today.

Read the guide &#8594; Large Language Models (LLMs) have moved from research labs into production applications at a remarkable pace. Developers are using them for everything from customer support chatbots to code generation tools to content creation systems. However, this rapid adoption brings an important question: how do we know if our LLM is actually working well? Unlike traditional software, where we can write unit tests that check for exact outputs, LLMs are probabilistic systems. Ask the same question twice, and the model might give different answers, both of which could be perfectly valid. This uncertainty makes evaluation challenging but absolutely necessary. This is where &#8220;evals&#8221; come in. Short for evaluations, evals are the systematic methods we use to measure how well our LLM performs. Without proper evaluation, we&#8217;re essentially flying blind, unable to know whether our latest prompt change made things better or worse, whether our model is ready for production, or whether it&#8217;s handling edge cases correctly.

## Post 216: Message Brokers 101: Storage, Replication, and Delivery Guarantees

**Publication:** ByteByteGo Newsletter
**Author:** ByteByteGo
**URL:** https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/message-brokers-101-storage-replication
**Published:** 2026-01-01T16:33:32+00:00

**Content Preview:**
A message broker is a middleware system that facilitates asynchronous communication between applications and services using messages. At its core, a broker decouples producers of information from consumers, allowing them to operate independently without direct knowledge of each other. This decoupling is foundational to modern distributed architectures, where services communicate through the broker rather than directly with one another, enabling them to evolve independently without tight coupling. To understand this in practice, consider an order-processing service that places an &#8220;Order Placed&#8221; message on a broker. Downstream services such as inventory, billing, and shipping will get that message from the broker when they are ready to process it, rather than the order service calling each one synchronously. This approach eliminates the need for the order service to know about or wait for these downstream systems. Message brokers are not merely pipes for data transmission. They are sophisticated distributed databases specialized for functionalities such as stream processing and task distribution. The fundamental value proposition of a message broker lies in its ability to introduce a temporal buffer between distinct systems. By allowing a producer to emit a message without waiting for a consumer to process it, the broker facilitates temporal decoupling. This ensures that a spike in traffic at the ingress point does not immediately overwhelm downstream services. In this article, we will look at how message brokers work in detail and explore the various patterns they enable in distributed system design. Fundamental Terms Read more...

Every click, message, and API call on the internet relies on network protocols. They define how data moves, who can talk, and how securely it all happens. At the foundation are transport protocols: TCP ensures reliable delivery, UDP prioritizes speed, and QUIC brings both worlds together over UDP. On top of that, HTTP powers the web, TLS secures it, and DNS translates names into addresses. Need remote access? That&#8217;s SSH. File transfers? SFTP or SMB. Real-time chat and media? WebSocket, WebRTC, and MQTT keep data flowing live. For identity and access, OAuth and OpenID handle authorization and authentication. In the backend, DHCP, NTP, ICMPv6, and LDAP quietly keep everything synchronized, addressed, and discoverable. From simple emails (SMTP, IMAP) to encrypted VPNs (WireGuard, IPsec), these protocols form the invisible language that keeps the internet connected and secure.

For example: Computer vision models could identify objects in photographs, but couldn&#8217;t describe what they saw. Natural language processing systems could write eloquent prose but remained blind to images. Audio processing models could transcribe speech, but had no visual context. This fragmentation represented a fundamental departure from how humans experience the world. Human cognition is inherently multimodal. We don&#8217;t just read text or just see images. We simultaneously observe facial expressions while listening to the tone of voice. We connect the visual shape of a dog with the sound of a bark and the written word &#8220;dog.&#8221; To create AI that truly operates in the real world, these separated sensory channels needed to converge. Multimodal Large Language Models represent this convergence. For example, GPT-4o can respond to voice input in just 232 milliseconds, matching human conversation speed. Google&#8217;s Gemini can process an entire hour of video in a single prompt. These capabilities emerge from a single unified neural network that can see, hear, and read simultaneously.

## Post 223: A Guide to Retry Pattern in Distributed Systems

**Author:** ByteByteGo
**URL:** https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/a-guide-to-retry-pattern-in-distributed
**Published:** 2025-12-18T16:31:12+00:00

**Content Preview:**
In a monolithic application, a function call is a local, in-memory process. Aside from a catastrophic hardware failure or a process crash, the execution of a function is essentially guaranteed. If the process is alive, the call succeeds. However, in distributed systems, this guarantee does not hold. Components communicate over physical networks that are inherently unreliable. This reality is captured in the &#8220;Fallacies of Distributed Computing,&#8221; specifically the first fallacy: &#8220;The network is reliable&#8221;. In truth, it is not. A request sent from Service A to Service B may fail not because Service B is broken, but simply because the communication medium momentarily faltered. This creates a need for defensive programming patterns, and one of the primary mechanisms we use is the Retry pattern. By automatically retrying a failed operation, a system can trade latency for availability, turning what would have been a failed user request into a successful one. However, retries are both essential and dangerous in distributed systems. On the one hand, they transform unreliable networks into reliable ones. But on the other hand, indiscriminate retries can lead to latency amplification, resource exhaustion, and cascading failures that can take down entire platforms. In this article, we will explore the retry pattern in depth, understand when and how to use it safely and effectively. What is a Retry? Read more...

When Meta announced in Q2 2025 that its new Generative Ads Model (GEM) had driven a 5% increase in ad conversions on Instagram and a 3% increase on Facebook Feed, the numbers might have seemed modest. However, at Meta&#8217;s scale, these percentages translate to billions of dollars in additional revenue and represent a fundamental shift in how AI-powered advertising works. GEM is the largest foundation model ever built for recommendation systems. It has been trained at the scale typically reserved for large language models like GPT-4 or Claude. Yet here&#8217;s the paradox: GEM is so powerful and computationally intensive that Meta can&#8217;t actually use it directly to serve ads to users.

Tinkering with prompts can only get you so far. (Sponsored) Most companies get stuck tinkering with prompts and wonder why their agents fail to deliver dependable results. This guide from You.com breaks down the evolution of agent management, revealing the five stages for building a successful AI agent and why most organizations haven&#8217;t gotten there yet. In this guide, you&#8217;ll learn: Why prompts alone aren&#8217;t enough and how context and metadata unlock reliable agent automation Four essential ways to calculate ROI, plus when and how to use each metric Real-world challenges at each stage of agent management and how to avoid them Go beyond the prompt: get the guide. When we first interact with large language models, the experience is straightforward. We type a prompt, the model generates a response, and the interaction ends. This single-turn approach works well for simple questions or basic content generation, but it quickly reveals its limitations when we tackle more complex tasks. Imagine asking an AI to analyze market trends, create a comprehensive report, and provide actionable recommendations. A single response, no matter how well-crafted, often falls short because it lacks the opportunity to gather additional information, reflect on its reasoning, or refine its output based on feedback. This is where agentic workflows come into play. Rather than treating AI interactions as one-and-done transactions, agentic workflows introduce iterative processes, tool integration, and structured problem-solving approaches. These workflows transform language models from sophisticated text generators into capable agents that can break down complex problems, adapt their strategies, and produce higher-quality results. The difference is similar to comparing a quick sketch to a carefully refined painting. Both have their place, but when quality and reliability matter, the iterative approach wins.

And in a fun crossover, Alex and Sahn from ByteByteGo will also take the stage. The exact agenda: We already have 250 confirmed attendees &#8212; experienced engineering leaders and experienced engineers &#8212; and just 150 seats left. We also have more delightful surprises planned for the event, and on the day &#8212; those who attend will learn of these. If you are thinking of joining, apply now , while there is still space. If you want to meet in-person, meet folks who have been on the podcast or in the deepdives, and connect with an incredible group at the event: this is the event to do it at. Talks will be recorded and shared with paid newsletter subscribers in a timely matter &#8212; and they will be published in batches for all newsletter subscribers later on as well.

This winter break was an opportunity for devs to step back from day-to-day work and play around with side projects &#8211; including using AI agents to juice up those half-baked or incomplete ideas. At least, that&#8217;s what I did with a few features I&#8217;d meant to build for months, but didn&#8217;t get around to during 2025: related to self-service group subscriptions for larger companies, and my custom-built admin panel for The Pragmatic Engineer. Unexpectedly, LLMs like Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 did amazing jobs on the mid-sized tasks I assigned them: I ended up pushing a few hundred lines of code to production simply by prompting the LLM, reviewing the output, making sure the tests passed (and new tests I prompted also passed!), then prompting it a bit more for some final tweaking. To add to the magical feeling, I then managed to build production software on my phone: I set up Claude Code for Web by connecting it to my GitHub, which let me instruct the Claude mobile app to make changes to my code and to add/run tests. Claude duly created PRs that triggered GitHub actions (which ran the tests Claude couldn&#8217;t) and I found myself reviewing and merging PRs with new functionality purely from my mobile device while travelling. Admittedly, it was low-risk work and all the business logic was covered by automated tests, but I hadn&#8217;t previously felt the thrill of &#8220;creating&#8221; code and pushing it to prod from my phone. This experience, also shared by many others, suggests to me that a step change is underway in software engineering tooling. In this article &#8211; the first of 2026 for this publication &#8211; we explore where we are, and what a monumental change like AI writing the lion&#8217;s share of code could mean for us developers.

Before we start, two things: Check out our new MCP report! Elin and I have done something experimental: create a more detailed report than even our MCP deepdive was. If you&#8217;d like to get deeper into the MCP ecosystem, check out the report . Feel free to give feedback, as we&#8217;d like to do more of these if there&#8217;s enough interest to justify the intensive research involved. This is the most detailed report on this topic that we know about. The Pragmatic Summit speaker list is nearly finalized. Speakers confirmed in the past few weeks include some names you may know as guests on the Pragmatic Engineer podcast: Chip Huyen , Martin Fowler , Nicole Forsgren , and Kent Beck . I&#8217;ll share the detailed agenda in early January. The event takes place on 11 February, in San Francisco. Apply here to secure a spot. The Pulse is a series covering events, insights, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Today, we cover: Internal dev tooling at Meta &amp; &#8220;trajectories.&#8221; An overview of three different internal AI-coding tools which devs at Meta use. Also, the company has started sharing the prompts which devs make when generating code &#8211; and it&#8217;s pretty controversial. GitHub upsets devs by charging for self-hosted CI/CD. GitHub Actions is notoriously slow and unreliable. But instead of improving the service, GitHub sought to charge by the minute for using third-party CI/CD solutions. That didn&#8217;t go down well with devs. Industry Pulse. Warsaw on track to become the &#8220;tech capital of the EU,&#8221; hiring juniors could actually be &#8220;profitable&#8221; thanks to AI tools, GitHub is working on stacked diffs, non-devs use LLMs for more coding tasks, Cursor migrates CMS to Markdown, OpenAI gets rid of 6-month vesting cliff, and more. &#8220;Apple Tax&#8221; alive in Japan.

## Post 234: How AWS deals with a major outage

**Publication:** The Pragmatic Engineer
**Author:** Gergely Orosz
**URL:** https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-aws-deals-with-a-major-outage
**Published:** 2025-12-16T16:58:00+00:00

**Content Preview:**
In October, the largest Amazon Web Services (AWS) region in the world suffered an outage lasting 15 hours, which created a global impact as thousands of sites and apps crashed or degraded &#8211; including Amazon.com, Signal, Snapchat, and others . AWS released an incident summary three days later, revealing the outage in us-east-1 was started by a failure inside DynamoDB&#8217;s DNS system, which then spread to Amazon EC2 and to AWS&#8217;s Network Load Balancer. The incident summary overlooked questions such as why it took so long to resolve, and some media coverage sought to fill the gap. The Register claimed that an &#8220;Amazon brain drain finally sent AWS down the spout&#8221;, because some AWS staff who knew the systems inside out had quit the company, and their institutional knowledge was sorely missed. For more clarity and detail, I went to an internal source at Amazon: Senior Principal Engineer, Gavin McCullagh , who was part of the crew which resolved this outage from start to finish. In this article, Gavin shares his insider perspective and some new details about what happened, and we find out how incident response works at the company. This article is based on Gavin&#8217;s account of the incident to me. We cover: Incident Response team at AWS. An overview of how global incident response works at the leading cloud provider, and a summary of Gavin&#8217;s varied background at AWS. Mitigating the outage (part 1). Rapid triage, two simultaneous problems, and extra details on how the DynamoDB outage was eventually resolved. What caused the outage? An unlucky, unexpected lock contention across the three DNS enactors started it all. Also, a clever usage of Route 53 as an optimistic locking mechanism. Oncall tooling &amp; outage coordination. Amazon&#8217;s outage severity scale, tooling used for paging and incident management, and why 3+ parallel calls are often run during a single outage. Mitigating the outage (part 2). After the DynamoDB outage was mitigat...

Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover Big Tech and startups through the lens of senior engineers and engineering leaders. If you&#8217;ve been forwarded this email, you can subscribe here . Begin researching developer productivity, and you&#8217;re likely to soon encounter the work of Nicole Forsgren, as lead author of the best-selling book Accelerate , and creator of the widely-adopted DORA and SPACE developer productivity frameworks. And, beyond SPACE is the DevEx framework for productivity measurement, created by Abi Noda in collaboration with Nicole. When I heard that the pair&#8217;s work together has continued in a new book about developer experience, I wanted to know more, and had the chance to sit down for a conversation about this big project of theirs. Frictionless was released two weeks ago, and Nicole and Noda have been nice enough to share an excerpt from their new title with readers of the Pragmatic Engineer, below. My copy of Frictionless The back cover of Frictionless reads: &#8220; AI can generate code in minutes &#8212; so why does shipping software still take forever? The answer is friction: the invisible barriers that turn quick wins into endless delays. While your competitors ship daily updates, your developers burn out fighting broken tools instead of solving real problems&#8221;. Personally, the lack of impact by AI coding tools to date upon the speed of development and quality of software, is amusing to me. If I take the apps I use, websites I visit, and services I access via software, I don&#8217;t see signs of faster iteration, higher quality, and fewer bugs since AI started shaking up the tech industry. An exception might be AI labs that release new features at eye-catching speed, often faster than much nimbler startups, but it could be argued those begin as experimental features. What I like about Frictionless is that it gives a step-by-step approach for developers to sm...

**Content Preview:**
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) was released almost exactly a year ago by Anthropic, and today, MCP is enjoying quite a moment, with strong growth in the numbers of devs building MCP servers. That might be related to MCP servers being a great way to give agents like Claude Code, Cursor Agent, and other LLMs new capabilities to use services, query documentation, and be more efficient. Adoption is widespread and diverse, across cutting-edge startups and regulated industries like aerospace alike. One year on, how are engineering teams using this technology, and what does that teach us? To find out, we collected input from 46 software engineers who build and use MCP servers at work, and talked with Jeremiah Lowin , CEO of Prefect and creator of FastMCP, the leading MCP framework for Python, and Den Delimarsky , core MCP maintainer and Principal Engineer at Microsoft. Thanks to everyone who shared their experience of building with MCP. Today, we cover: MCP fundamentals. Brief recap of the protocol. Usage realities. Internal MCP server usage outpaces its public usage, business stakeholders are heavy MCP users, and other details. How teams use MCP. Based on a dozen use cases, there are varied ways of using it. Popular public MCP servers. Stats from widely-used public MCP servers operated by Sentry and Linear, plus an odd conjunction of thousands of DAUs and millions of daily sessions. Security considerations. Security&#8217;s still the Achilles heel of MCPs and LLMs. There are some sensible security practices for treading carefully in the space. Learnings from building MCPs. Start small and local, choose the development language carefully, design primitives for agents and not humans &#8211; &amp; more. Useful tools for building MCP servers. FastMCP, MCP Inspector, and Cloudflare&#8217;s remote MCP guide among the top mentions. Our look into MCP usage suggests that using, building, and maintaining MCP servers are on the way to becoming part of the software engineering tool...

Try it yourself. In this episode Michelle Lim joined Warp as engineer number one and is now building her own startup, Flint . She brings a strong product-first mindset shaped by her time at Facebook, Slack, Robinhood, and Warp. Michelle shares why she chose Warp over safer offers, how she evaluates early-stage opportunities, and what she believes distinguishes great founding engineers. Together, we cover how product-first engineers create value, why negotiating equity at early-stage startups requires a different approach, and why asking founders for references is a smart move. Michelle also shares lessons from building consumer and infrastructure products, how she thinks about tech stack choices, and how engineers can increase their impact by taking on work outside their job descriptions. If you want to understand what founders look for in early engineers or how to grow into a founding-engineer role, this episode is full of practical advice backed by real examples.

## Post 240: A pragmatic guide to LLM evals for devs

**Publication:** The Pragmatic Engineer
**Author:** Gergely Orosz
**URL:** https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/evals
**Published:** 2025-12-02T17:19:57+00:00

**Content Preview:**
One word that keeps cropping up when I talk with software engineers who build large language model (LLM)-based solutions is &#8220; evals &#8221;. They use evaluations to verify that LLM solutions work well enough because LLMs are non-deterministic, meaning there&#8217;s no guarantee they&#8217;ll provide the same answer to the same question twice. This makes it more complicated to verify that things work according to spec than it does with other software, for which automated tests are available. Evals feel like they are becoming a core part of the AI engineering toolset. And because they are also becoming part of CI/CD pipelines, we, software engineers, should understand them better &#8212; especially because we might need to use them sooner rather than later! So, what do good evals look like, and how should this non-deterministic-testing space be approached? For directions, I turned to an expert on the topic, Hamel Husain . He&#8217;s worked as a Machine Learning engineer at companies including Airbnb and GitHub, and teaches the online course AI Evals For Engineers &amp; PMs &#8212; the upcoming cohort starts in January . Hamel is currently writing a book, Evals for AI Engineers , to be published by O&#8217;Reilly next year. In today&#8217;s issue, we cover: Vibe-check development trap. An agent appears to work well, but as soon as it is modified, it can&#8217;t be established that it&#8217;s working correctly. Core workflow: error analysis . Error analysis has been a key part of machine learning for decades and is useful for building LLM applications. Building evals: the right tools for the job. Use code-based evals for deterministic failures, and an LLM-as-judge for subjective cases. Building an LLM-as-judge. Avoid your LLM judge memorizing answers by partitioning your data and measuring how well the judge generalizes to unfamiliar data. Align the judge, keep trust. The LLM judge&#8217;s expertise needs to be validated against human expertise. Consider metrics l...

Check out Linear. &#8212; In this episode As software engineers, what should we know about writing secure code? Johannes Dahse is the VP of Code Security at Sonar and a security expert with 20 years of industry experience. In today&#8217;s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, he joins me to talk about what security teams actually do, what developers should own, and where real-world risk enters modern codebases. We cover dependency risk, software composition analysis, CVEs, dynamic testing, and how everyday development practices affect security outcomes. Johannes also explains where AI meaningfully helps, where it introduces new failure modes, and why understanding the code you write and ship remains the most reliable defense. If you build and ship software, this episode is a practical guide to thinking about code security under real-world engineering constraints. Interesting quotes from the episode: How code quality and code security are connected: Gergely: &#8220;How does the quality of code relate to security?&#8221; Johannes: &#8220;This is an underrated topic in the industry today.

Across tech, the average tenure of software engineers seems to be rising, not least in Big Tech where it has increased rapidly. With today&#8217;s chilly job market having a dampening effect on the number of engineers switching jobs, it&#8217;s possible that staying in a role for years will become pretty normal for many in our industry. So, if you can see yourself at your current workplace for the longer term, it&#8217;s sensible to consider the career path options available, and how to get promoted to the next level. To shed light on these topics and others, I sought out someone who has managed large engineering orgs at a massive company. Ethan Evans is precisely such a person; he was a Vice President of Engineering at Amazon, and has overseen the growth and promotions of more than 1,000 engineers(!) over the course of his career. Now recently retired from the online retail giant, Ethan can candidly discuss how large companies operate, and which tactics and strategies really work and help colleagues to enjoy thriving careers in big workplaces. These days, Ethan teaches engineers and engineering managers how to get promoted faster, and runs live courses . He&#8217;s also built a 24/7 personalized &#8220;AI career coach&#8221; , and shares career growth advice in his weekly newsletter, Level Up.

## Post 248: One bottleneck at a time

**Publication:** The Engineering Manager
**Author:** James Stanier

**Published:** 2026-01-14T17:02:17+00:00

This month, we&#8217;re going to think about our teams, departments, and organisations as systems. Specifically, we&#8217;re going to consider how we can increase throughput and output by identifying and removing the biggest bottleneck at any given time. This might sound obvious, but it&#8217;s surprisingly rare in practice. Most leaders spread their effort across many initiatives simultaneously, making partial progress on everything and completing nothing. The insight we&#8217;ll explore is that systems don&#8217;t work that way: there&#8217;s always one constraint that matters most, and focusing elsewhere is, at best, wasted effort. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to cover: We&#8217;ll start by looking at a pattern I call the scattered leader , which is the well-intentioned but ineffective approach of fighting on multiple fronts at once. Then we&#8217;ll dig into the core insight from Eliyahu Goldratt&#8217;s The Goal and the Theory of Constraints: every system has a single primary bottleneck, and improving anything else doesn&#8217;t improve the system. We&#8217;ll look at a practical example of what happens when you put your best people on unglamorous but critical work. And we&#8217;ll talk about the courage required to subordinate everything else to fixing the bottleneck. If you find this topic interesting, here are some complementary articles from the archive: The beauty of constraints reframes constraints as tools rather than obstacles. The contribution curve explains why hiring doesn&#8217;t instantly help, since new people are net-negative contributors initially. Delegation covers how spreading knowledge reduces single points of failure. But for now, let&#8217;s focus on bottlenecks. Let&#8217;s get going.

Welcome to the subscribers edition for December. Thanks again for being a subscriber; I really appreciate it. As always, the subscriber chat is open if you want to send me your thoughts and feedback in order to shape the future of this newsletter. Message me any time. I&#8217;m always listening. As we close out 2025, I&#8217;ve been reflecting on a question that I&#8217;ve been asked more than any other this year: &#8220;How do I get my team to actually use AI to its full potential?&#8221; It&#8217;s a question that comes up at conferences, online, and in one-to-ones with other leaders. And I get it: driving AI adoption has been a core part of my role this year. When I started my current CTO role, I came off the back of intense accelerated AI adoption at Shopify and had been extensively experimenting with LLMs for my own work, using them as thinking partners, research assistants, and coding companions. As part of my interview and onboarding process, there was a clear feeling that AI wasn&#8217;t being used enough in the engineering organization, and that they wanted me to come in and drive adoption to increase throughput. But the question was: how? This initial mismatch (which is now dramatically different) became one of the most interesting leadership challenges I&#8217;ve faced. How do you drive adoption of something when you can&#8217;t force people to see its value? How do you create the conditions for playful and healthy discovery rather than mandating compliance? Throughout 2025, we&#8217;ve seen the media report on companies taking a strong-arm approach; effectively declaring it an immediate performance issue if engineers aren&#8217;t utilizing AI tools. While that is one way to go about it, I prefer a more organic approach that I think works better for most organizations that aren&#8217;t the top 0.1% big technology companies. If you&#8217;ve been following along with my previous articles on AI, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;ve written extensively about usi...

This month, we&#8217;re going to continue exploring the mental models that Charlie Munger covered in Poor Charlie&#8217;s Almanack , a compendium of 11 talks given throughout his life. The book culminates in one final, bumper-sized talk that is a collection of over 20 mental models that he attributed to his success. Last month&#8217;s article covered one of these models: &#8220;invert, always invert&#8221; , which is a method for thinking about problems by flipping them on their head and considering the worst that could happen, and then ensuring that you don&#8217;t ever make that the case. It turns out that doesn&#8217;t just work for investing but it also works well for the kinds of problems that we face in software engineering: designing resilient systems, planning rollouts, and ensuring that you have a backup plan in case something goes wrong. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. This month, we&#8217;re going to look at another one of these mental models: &#8220;use it or lose it.&#8221; This mental model is becoming increasingly relevant as AI becomes more ubiquitous in our lives. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to cover in the article: We&#8217;ll start with an introduction to the use-it-or-lose-it model, looking at real examples ranging from playing an instrument to doing exercise. Then we&#8217;ll cover how &#8220;use it or lose it&#8221; has affected managers for a long time, and how AI may be potentially compounding that effect. We&#8217;ll then consider whether there are ways we can use AI more intentionally to potentially preserve our critical thinking skills. And then, to finish, we&#8217;ll see how AI may actually be able to pave the way to us becoming broader generalists as managers, in a manner that supports our desire to be in the details and thrive in today&#8217;s flatter organizations. So, as we begin to approach the end of 2025, let&#...

Introduction Here&#8217;s part two of November&#8217;s paid newsletter. We pick up where we left off in part one, which is where Brandwatch had been acquired and it was time to move up and move on. In this second part, we&#8217;ll cover: The executive recruitment process, which I had to learn and navigate for the first time. How exactly do unadvertised roles get filled? My move to Shopify, which was driven not only by a desire to learn and grow at somewhere famous, but most importantly supported the kind of life that I wanted. How economic change led to cultural change, and why becoming a parent forces the hard choices. We cover my current CTO role and how I got it, by picking up the connections that I&#8217;d made some 3.5 years previous. We begin the story during 2021, in Cumbria, during lockdown. We&#8217;d been acquired and it was clear that the company would never be the same. It was going to be difficult saying goodbye mentally to something that had been part of my life for nearly ten years, but when you feel that it&#8217;s time, it&#8217;s time. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Getting to grips with executive recruitment The question was, therefore, what to do next. I was in two minds. Part of me thought that now was the time to step up and be CTO for the first time; however, I didn&#8217;t really know how to do this. On the other hand, part of me was observing so many great companies starting to fully embrace remote work, and also hiring like crazy , and I saw this as an opportunity to get in at a good time with some of these proverbial rocket ships. I decided to take a two-pronged approach. I needed to work out how CTO roles were recruited, and I also needed to look at what companies out there were hiring remotely in the UK. Read more...

Introduction Welcome to the paid newsletter for November 2025. This is the first ever paid article that I&#8217;ve written, so I&#8217;d like to thank you for being an early adopter of the paid subscription model. I hope you&#8217;ll find the content enlightening and engaging. I like to see it as the beginning of a conversation between us. As I write more paid articles, I&#8217;d love to hear your feedback. I&#8217;ve opened the Subscriber Chat functionality on Substack so you can contact me directly. This way, you get the chance to shape the future of the newsletter. We are going to start this month by diving into my story of how I ended up in a CTO role at a public company. I think this might be interesting because it wasn&#8217;t always my intention. Rather, it was a random walk , to use a computer science term, following my interests, that got me here. Additionally, CTO roles are very rarely advertised externally, so I&#8217;d like to give you some insight into how the world of executive headhunting works. If you&#8217;re interested in going down this path yourself, then I hope you&#8217;ll learn more about how to get involved. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that everyone&#8217;s journey will be different. There is no one way to do this. So, consider this not a blueprint, but rather a map of the terrain that I&#8217;ve traversed. The easiest way to become CTO, after all, is to &#8220;just&#8221; start your own company. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. What&#8217;s coming up Since I wanted to use this opportunity to go deeper than usual in my writing, this newsletter is going to be split into two parts. In part one, we&#8217;re going to cover the following: My original interest and desire to get a permanent position in academia, but how the economy, jobs market, and my desired life situation prevented me from going any further. How it was almost random th...

I recently finished Poor Charlie&#8217;s Almanack , a collection of eleven talks by Charlie Munger. When Stripe Press published a brand new edition of it with their usual beautiful type setting and cover design, I couldn&#8217;t resist. For those unfamiliar to Charlie, he is worth getting to know. While his notoriety stemmed from being one of the greatest investors of his generation, he was also a prolific speaker and writer, and was an advocate of cross-disciplinary thinking and application of mental models. He excelled in taking ideas from mathematics, philosophy, and psychology in order to think about the world in a new way. In this month&#8217;s article, we&#8217;re going to be looking at one of the mental models I learned from Charlie and how it can help us as engineering leaders think, plan, and execute better by avoiding failure. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. But first, some changes However, before we go any further, I wanted to take this opportunity to say that there are going to be some changes coming up to how this newsletter is run. Currently I publish one article a month for free, which is also available on my website, The Engineering Manager . Don&#8217;t worry: this is going to continue indefinitely. I have been slowly growing my optional paid subscriber base, of which membership is purely voluntary, and I wanted to start giving something more to them, and also see whether I can continue to grow it. As a result, I&#8217;m now going to be writing twice a month. There will be one free article, which will continue as it always has, with the addition of one paid article, which will not be published anywhere else: it will only be available here on Substack for paid subscribers. The price for subscriptions will remain exactly the same, which is: US $10 monthly , if you prefer the flexibility to cancel any time. US $100 for the whole year, which...

Introduction It&#8217;s been two months since I finished a sequence of LLM-based posts which were intended to think of unique ways that you could improve your leadership skills by leaning into AI as a coach, a contrarian thinker, and a way in which to expand and accelerate your decision-making. If you&#8217;re interested in reviewing those posts, then you can find them here, in reverse chronological order: Leadership co-processing with LLMs , which introduces a number of prompting and usage ideas that could help you develop your thinking. A bag of worries: tackling overwhelm with LLMs , which is a technique I&#8217;ve been using to help me manage my own never-ending to-do list by offloading some of the cognitive load of prioritization to an LLM. A weekly mind meld , which uses some LLM assistance to communicate weekly with my department. LLMs: an operator&#8217;s view , the original post in this series, which covers some of the cultural change addressed in the first post in this list, and how code review and hiring are also changing. Building on the leadership co-processing article, we&#8217;re going to go further this week and think about how we can expand our usage of a thinking partner into multiple thinking partners by using LLM agents to create your own councils that you can use to accelerate and supercharge your thinking and also simulate situations where many actors may not have default consensus on issues.

Inspiration At work, I&#8217;ve mostly been using Claude Code as my go-to interface. Generally speaking, I like the Claude models, which have become particularly good since Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 were released. However, I also enjoy the terminal interface, which I always keep open at the side of the screen as it is space efficient. I can mix regular prompting along with the generation of code, and it looks cool...

**Content Preview:**
This week we are going to take a deep dive into constraints: one of the most powerful tools that you have as a leader to help your team deliver more with less. Now, this isn&#8217;t the first time that we&#8217;ve written about constraints, so if you&#8217;re interested: We looked at Parkinson&#8217;s Law back in 2024, which is the classic anti-pattern that occurs when people are given too much time (or no deadline at all) when asked to do something. The result is that work &#8212; like gas &#8212; expands to fill the time available, and yes, we&#8217;ve all been there with our school assignments. We covered the iron triangle of project management in 2017 , which is the classic model of the three constraints that projects typically have: scope, resources, and time. The idea is that you can only ever optimize two of the three. We more recently explored how scope could be reframed as thoroughness in 2024, since scope alone rarely tells the whole story about what is being delivered. But this time we&#8217;re talking about constraints as tools . Tools that you wield and can use. Discovering places where you can add constraints to your projects is a superpower: it unlocks unconventional thinking, forces people to prioritize ruthlessly, and leads to unexpected and surprising results. Let&#8217;s go on a journey together to explore the beauty of constraints. We&#8217;ll start by examining their paradoxical nature. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The constraint paradox The word &#8220;constraint&#8221; often has a negative connotation. If you asked an average person, being &#8220;constrained&#8221; in general would not be seen as a desirable state. One does not wish to wear a pair of trousers that make them feel constrained. However, paradoxically, constraints in engineering can often lead to our best work. The longstanding meme of IT projects being over budget ...

## Post 257: Going direct

After a series of posts on LLMs, we're returning to management fundamentals. This month, we're building upon the cultural shift that management has experienced recently: smaller, leaner and tighter orgs. We'll build upon concepts from our previous articles: new advice for aspiring managers , should managers still code? , and being in the details . This article, plus those listed above, reflect a new and expected management style for the current era: more hands-on, detail-oriented, and direct. This shift is driven by tighter economic conditions and the push for AI-driven efficiency . The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Let's examine the concept of "going direct." What is going direct? Going direct means empowering everyone on your team to communicate openly and directly, without unnecessary intermediaries. This communication can be lateral (peer-to-peer) or diagonal (across different departments and levels), bypassing formal reporting chains. Org charts are essential for defining roles, ownership, and facilitating performance management. However, people often mistakenly believe these charts also dictate communication paths, feeling obligated to follow the hierarchy. At best, this requires irritating message-passing. At worst, it dramatically slows down work and fosters bureaucracy. An example best illustrates why this is an anti-pattern. Imagine person X in Team A needs to talk to person Y in Team B. These teams are in different departments, led by peer managers M and N, respectively. When communication follows the org chart, X must tell their manager, who tells their manager M. M then talks to N (or perhaps even their shared manager) to pass the message down N's reporting line to Y. Wow, that was a mouthful. As you can see, this is incredibly inefficient. When you read it back, it&#8217;s borderline ridiculous. X should be able to talk to Y directly. Not onl...

Over the last few months, I've been writing about a number of factors that AI &#8212; specifically LLMs &#8212; are changing the way the role of management works. If you haven't read the previous posts, then they are as follows, in descending order of publication: New advice for aspiring managers , which covers how the cultural shift in our industry is changing the way we think about management and how aspiring managers should adapt to that change. A bag of worries: tackling overwhelm with LLMs , which is a technique I've been using to help me manage my own never-ending to-do list by offloading some of the cognitive load of prioritization to an LLM. A weekly mind meld , which uses some LLM assistance to communicate weekly with my department. LLMs: an operator's view , the original post in this series, which covers some of the cultural change addressed in the first post in this list, and how code review and hiring are also changing. I'm always trying to find new ways to use LLMs because it's both useful and a lot of fun. One of the unsurprising elements of being a CTO is that the buck stops with me when it comes to decisions about my engineering department, so I've been leaning more on LLMs to help me evolve my thinking, challenge my assumptions, and make better decisions. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. I thought I'd write up some of the ways that I've been doing that in the hope that it might help other engineering leaders to do the same. Effectively, I now think of LLMs as a co-processor for my brain. It isn't always correct or even trustworthy, but in practice it always puts momentum behind my thinking, and often helps me to see things from a different perspective. Here's what we'll cover in this post: Prompting : using LLMs to help me think through problems. Pair prompting : using LLMs to help me work on solutions with a human partner. Deep research ...

I had a conversation with a colleague the other week who is interested in moving into management. It was during this conversation that I realized just how different my advice is now compared to even a few years ago, so I thought it would be worth writing down and sharing more broadly. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. What hasn't changed Before getting into everything that has changed, I wanted to point out something that is still important and true: the world needs more great leaders. It is something that I believed when I thought I'd give the job a shot myself many years ago, and it is the reason that my books and this newsletter exist (especially when I write it right up to the deadline...) Managing teams is hard but can be incredibly rewarding. It gives you the opportunity to help people grow, succeed, and be happy. It lets you build great products that you couldn't build alone. And, over time, as you look back at all of the people that you mentored and see how they've all gone on to do great things, it can be one of the most fulfilling things you can do in your career. So, there is a place for you in management if all of that sounds appealing to you. But the manner in which you will do it, and the environment that you will be doing it in, is very different. Companies reflect the world around them Managers exist within a new world. A lot has changed. We've been though a pandemic, a recession, and for the first time in a long time, interest rates are high and there is far less cheap capital for companies to use in the form of investment or credit. For anyone that got into management in the last 15 years, fiscally, it couldn't be more distinct. Over the ZIRP period, cheap capital meant plenty of investment into technology companies, and that meant a lot budget and a lot of hiring. Lots of hiring needs lots of managers, and that meant that there were plen...

In this issue of the newsletter, we get creative with LLMs in order to overcome the mental block of having a ton of things to do. Brought to you by: Volv delivers the most breaking and interesting news in 9-second reads. No fluff&#8212;just sharp, credible facts. You might even find some of my writing on there. Download Volv &#8212;free, fast, no clutter. If you've had periods in your leadership journey where you feel like you're generating more to-do items than you can handle, then you're not alone. Every day, you might add five or ten items to your list, each representing an entire project that could take weeks or even months to complete. For example, after a busy Monday your list might have the following items added to it: Review increasing infrastructure costs and propose optimizations. Plan team offsite for next quarter including budget and agenda. Look into security audit findings and create action plan. Prepare for upcoming performance reviews and set criteria. Sigh. And that's on top of the existing huge items that you already have on your list from last week which you haven't had the time to deal with yet. This can lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed, like you're carrying around a heavy mental load. Each item on your list feels like a weight, and the more you add, the heavier it gets. Although the pragmatist may say that the solution is simply to put time aside to properly triage, prioritize, and delegate or action these items, this is easier said than done. At the end of a busy day I'm usually pretty tired, and the creative juice that I need to properly think through these items is often in short supply. My own mental resistance to dealing with these items is often the biggest barrier to getting them done, rather than the actual complexity of the items themselves. Long days with lots of context switching can seriously deplete my mental capacity. I wrote about managing this capacity in a previous article , noting how it can expand and contract based on t...

Leaders can often find it hard to build deep trust and alignment with their teams, especially if those teams are quite big, or if the leader in question is quite senior. Doing regular skip-skip-skip levels is out of the question, attending every meeting is impossible, and the power dynamics of the org can make it hard for staff to really get to know you one-on-one. You need a solution that works for you and your team, and allows the most efficient use of everyone's time, and is also archival, searchable, and shareable. The good news is that this solution already exists, and it predates slideshows, videos, and, come to think of it, even the internet. It's called writing. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Since starting my new CTO role, I've been sharing a weekly update with my team. I think about it as a mind meld , which has the Wiktionary definition of: From the Star Trek franchise, where the term was first used in 1966 for a telepathic ability possessed by the alien race of Vulcans to share thoughts and feelings with another individual. It's how I continually open up my thoughts to the team with a long-term goal to reduce any mental alignment gap between us. I like to think that the more I share, the more they can understand what I believe is important and why, and the more that my style of working and thinking can propagate through the team. There are a few rules and guidelines I follow when writing these mind melds. They should: Take no longer than 60 minutes to write. Be no longer than 1,500 words. Be sent out on a Friday afternoon as a way to close the week. Have a conversational tone and high ease of reading, similar to how I write this newsletter. Mix general updates with praise and feedback on things we can do better. Be sent to the entire team in a way that anyone in the company can also read it. I will call out that because I have done a ton of ...

Many of you that read my articles are operators of some kind. You may run one or many teams, or even a whole company. And, even if you are not a manager by definition, you may wield a great deal of influence over directions and decisions. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. In the midst of the current LLM explosion, we as operators find ourselves amongst: A blistering pace of improvement in the capabilities of LLMs. New models and products are being released at a rate that is hard to keep up with. Immense noise and hype online making all sorts of claims, good and bad, about what the future holds. An expectation from our companies to go full-on with "AI", which typically means LLMs, both in developer tooling and in customer-facing products. AI is the new data is the new cloud. Echoes in the industry that we are all now overstaffed as a result of productivity gains: that everyone should do more with less, and that AI is the answer to that. Note: this article is not a technical overview of how to build products with LLMs. Instead, the intent is to touch upon what leadership should do from the perspective of the productivity of teams and organizations, and consequently how we should think about spending our budgets to make that happen. There are plenty of hot takes out there on AI. This is not intended to be one of them. What we'll cover related to LLMs is: The (real) rising floor of developer productivity. The changing size of organizations. The increasing importance of code reviews. The changing nature of interviews and identifying talent in short spaces of time. The intent is that this should provoke thought and discussion, and will hopefully help you think about how to allocate your budget and focus in the coming months and years. The floor is rising With Copilot , Cursor , Cline and other LLM-based developer tools, the floor of developer productivity is ris...

## Post 263: Should managers still code?

This month we have a mailbag question from a reader who asks: Hi James, Your newsletter "being in the details" resonated with me. I would like to ask your opinion about managers writing code. I skim PRs but don&#8217;t critically review them and don&#8217;t write code. Should EMs write code in their day job? Thanks! The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. It's a great question, and given the higher scrutiny we've seen on the role of engineering managers in the past few years, it's worth spending some time on it. Before we go any deeper, the short answer is that it depends exactly on what you mean by coding. I think that there is a big difference between being in the code and writing code. All managers should be in the code, but not all managers should be writing code. But spending some time digging into the nuances of the question can, I think, highlight both the practical aspects of ensuring that managers are sufficiently in the code, and, more importantly, identify the existential worry that many engineering managers may have about their role, and what they can do about it. Let's get going. Refresher: measuring your impact We'll begin by revisiting Andy Grove's equation for measuring a manager's impact, which states that the output of a manager is the output of their team, plus the output of the neighboring teams under their influence . This is always useful to refer to when thinking about how to spend your time. I contemplate it a lot. There are, of course, a multitude of ways to increase your output as a manager. These range from, and are not limited to: Hiring and retaining great people. Owning the team's strategy and roadmap, and ensuring efficient execution. Making decisions to ensure that the team is working on the right things and saying no to the things that don't matter. Dealing with fires, escalations, and other crises that pop up all of the time.

Since my November article on being in the details , I've had a few people ask me about the system that I use in order to do so. In my first book I went into great detail about how I manage information and stay organized. On reflection, my approach has evolved since then, so I thought it would be a good time to revisit the topic. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The system that you use to organize your activity becomes your mental model of how you do management. Therefore it should reflect how you work and how your company works, and produce the outputs that you need to be effective in your role. This, of course, means that what works for me might not work for you, and vice versa, and that's OK. The key is to have a system that you trust and that you use consistently to get the outcomes that you need. At the time of writing, I'm in an engineering leadership position at Shopify, which is a fully remote company with a culture of minimal meetings and a preference for asynchronous communication . This clearly has an impact on how I work and how I manage information, especially when compared to my previous roles at companies with an office-based culture. For example, I now no longer need to keep a notepad handy to jot down things as I'm walking around the office (I'm at home), nor do I get to exercise my preference of using wonderful, searchable, archivable email as my primary communication tool (everyone uses Slack instead; you can't win them all). Although my approach has evolved over the last few years, the fundamentals remain the same: Management of large organizations can quickly become overwhelming and messy if you don't have some way of managing the information that you need to keep track of. Your memory does not have a large enough working set to reliably keep track of all the information that you should have close to hand. If you think it is, you're li...

## Post 265: 2024: the year in review

**Publication:** The Engineering Manager

**Published:** 2024-12-29T15:49:35+00:00

**Content Preview:**
Over the last few weeks, I've been taking some time to step back and think about what I've seen, felt, and learnt this year so I can share it with you. 2024 has been a wild ride. Not since the smartphone boom period in 2007 have I seen so much change happening so quickly. We've seen the culture and growth of our companies changing due to the macroeconomic climate, a proliferation of LLM-based tools and technologies, and, fundamentally, as leaders, we've had to change how we think about our roles and our output. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. What has held true in the last decade may not hold true in the next. Let's take a look at each of these areas in turn. Efficiency is key Let's start with culture. If there is one theme to highlight as we head into next year, it would be efficiency . I have written before about the increasing need for managers to be in the details as we ride out this current macroeconomic period. The economy is presently characterized by less cheap debt and investment being available, and the knock-on effect is that there is less growth and a more challenging environment for startups. If you work for a bigger company, you will likely see headcount staying stable so that the balance sheet can be kept under control. People who leave may not get backfilled. Asking for more people to get things done is no longer a viable strategy. For those who are in the initial half of their careers, this is a new experience. For over a decade we have been able to raise, borrow, and grow our way out of problems. Now, we need to be efficient as a primary goal. But how long will this last? Looking at the charts on layoffs.fyi , we can see that an increase in layoffs began in 2022 as we exited the COVID Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) period. The magnitude of these layoffs peaked in 2023, and they have been on a downward trend since. It looks, dare I say...

**Published:** 2024-11-30T13:26:04+00:00

**Content Preview:**
In recent years companies have been flattening , creating fewer layers of management between the top and the bottom of the org chart. This is a reversal of the rapid growth during the zero interest-rate policy (ZIRP) phase during COVID-19, which created a glut of new managers under which to slot newly hired engineers. Efficiency is the play now. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Tech companies are opting to keep their size fixed as they ride out the current economic phase that has higher interest rates and less cheap investment available. As a result, managers are now expected to have more direct reports, less layers, and to be more hands-on with their teams. Some newer managers find this strange. Being hands-on, however, is not a new thing. In the 1980s, Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel, wrote about the importance of being in the details in his book High Output Management . In the book, he talked about how he would regularly walk the floor of the factories to see what was going on, and how he would ask probing questions to workers at all levels to understand the details of what was happening in his organization. This might sound familiar: we've seen this in recent years with Elon Musk , who is known for being deeply involved in the details of his companies. Building a full picture based on your own experience of what is going on means you can make better decisions and intervene and correct course when necessary. So, we need to be efficient as the economy is calling for it. And we need to know the details so that we can achieve that efficiency by using our time and people wisely. Yet, there has been some cultural resistance to this trend from some managers, claiming that the job of management is to be strategic and to delegate all of the details to others. Getting close to the details has been seen as meddling or even as a sign of having a lack of trust in you...

## Post 267: Solving staffing challenges with concentric circles

As you begin to lead organizations that are of a reasonable size, such as in the hundreds of engineers, you will find that staffing is one of the most repetitive and challenging aspects of your job. Ensuring that you have enough people focused on the right things, with the right skills, and in the right places is a never-ending task. It is also by definition unsatisfiable: you will never have enough people to do everything you want (or&nbsp; need ) to do, and you will never have the perfect mix of skills and experience either. The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Organizations of this size typically span a wide range of products, technologies, and geographies, further complicating the issue of having the right number of people working on the right things. You&#8217;ll have production code that needs to be maintained, new features that need to be built, and bugs and support issues that need to be addressed. It&#8217;s a balancing act. When inevitably a team&#8217;s project pivots, expands in scope, or is just plain harder than expected, you&#8217;ll be asked to provide them more people to help. However, this isn&#8217;t straightforward as everyone else is equally busy. If you find yourself in&nbsp; wartime &nbsp;it may be the case that you can&#8217;t rely on hiring your way out of the problem either. So, let&#8217;s imagine that one of your 30 teams is asking for more people. What do you do? Stack ranking: it&#8217;s not that simple Before we think about what to do, perhaps we should imagine ourselves in that team&#8217;s shoes. What are they&nbsp; expecting &nbsp;you to do when they ask for more people? If they have a new and important thing to do, they may assume that you will prioritize their work over other lower-priority work, thus allowing people to move from the less important thing to the more important thing. This assumes that you have a continual&nb...

Picture a company that has approximately 100 engineers, over multiple teams, that is rapidly hiring. Knowing what software you&#8217;re actually running This sounds trite, but it&#8217;s surprisingly hard to get a single view of all the software that you own and operate. Who owns which services and products Before you grew quickly, collective ownership worked well. There was high shared context, and everyone knew a little bit about everything. However, as you split into multiple teams, you need to distribute services and products to teams. Who owns what, and where do I go to talk to them about it?

They may be real &#8212; no money in the bank to hire people! &#8212; or artificial &#8212; an internal project deadline set by a manager, with no downsides if that deadline is not hit.

Static analysis refers to analysing the code of a program, without needing to run it. The goal of static analysis is to find bugs, inconsistencies, design issues and other quirks within your program. This is different from dynamic analysis - analysis performed whilst the program is running. Unit testing is an example of dynamic analysis. Static analysis tools run over a portion of your codebase, perform analysis, and report back their findings.

I put this down to only working in &#8216;default dead&#8217; startups, where speed really is one of the only advantages you have. When shipping is your company&#8217;s heartbeat , speed is generally good thing to optimise for. But how do we avoid ending up with a spaghetti mess of a codebase in the meantime? This edition focuses on techniques you can use to keep your codebase healthy, despite rapid change. What does maintainable mean? For every line of code written, a maintenance cost is incurred &#8212; the cost of supporting that code into the future.

Get used to it &#8212; it&#8217;s a very reasonable question! We&#8217;re here to talk about scoping : a process of answering that question. What is scoping? Scoping work is the process of going from the vague to the precise: from the idea of a feature, to a plan for how you might build it. It&#8217;s a broadly applicable skill &#8212; it isn&#8217;t unique to software engineering. When you scope, the goal is to figure out and define what problem you&#8217;re trying to solve, and propose an idea for how you&#8217;ll solve it. The problems you&#8217;re trying to solve might be: Adding a new button to your homepage Building a new authentication system Rolling out an engineering progression framework This is not estimation. Estimation is giving an idea of how long something will take to build. You need a clear scope to be able to give that estimate. The output of any scoping work I do is always a proposal.

&#128075; Hey. I didn&#8217;t know whether to post this week. This newsletter seems remarkably unimportant in comparison to the many important events over the past few weeks. Ultimately, I decided to write out of personal enjoyment. With this lens on, I hope it brings you a small amount of happiness. First, I&#8217;m matching donations to charities that support Black Lives Matter related causes (up to &#163;500, but if I see higher demand, I&#8217;ll up it).

Each gear behaves differently, and is optimised for a certain purpose. Low gears give immediate acceleration power. High gears allow you to efficiently travel long distances. Driving in 1st gear down the motorway will certainly destroy your car. Attempting to pull off from the lights in 5th gear will mean you get nowhere. I think there&#8217;s a tenuous analogy with shipping software here. Let&#8217;s imagine that the gears of a car represent the timeframe we&#8217;re optimising for : for example, the next two weeks, vs. 2 years from now. Lower gears represent caring about speed in immediate time periods, higher gears represent speed over distant time periods. We can shift between gears ...

At the highest level, they define a problem, and how you propose to solve it. You might also hear them referred to as RFCs . I prefer the word proposal as the acronym tends to exclude non-technical folks for no good reason. Why write them? They're useful for a few different reasons: Writing your thoughts down is a forcing function for clear thinking . You can&#8217;t convince others if you don&#8217;t understand the idea yourself. They amplify the underlying strength of the idea. I&#8217;ve never seen a good idea that didn&#8217;t get get stronger after writing a proposal. Weak ideas become self-evident after yo...

Hello. &#128075;&#127996; Building software at high growth companies &#8212; startups mostly &#8212; is a weird experience. Things often feel broken. Code quality feels low. But yet, the system works - often very well. Why? Should we be fine with this? New engineers are joining constantly. How do you avoid calcifying knowledge within your most tenured engineers, at a disadvantage to new employees? Work within these companies is growing ever more popular. But, there&#8217;s a lack of discussion about the art of building software within these environments, and the constraints they provide. I&#8217;d like to fix that. Who am I, and why am I doing this? My name is&nbsp; Stephen Whitworth . I&#8217;m currently a Senior Software Engineer at Monzo Bank, where I&#8217;m helping fight financial crime. Before that, I co-founded&nbsp; Ravelin : one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing fraud prevention startups. I&#8217;ve spent the past 7 years working for high growth companies. My path has followed a &#8216;do-what-needs-to-be-done&#8217; path: software engineering, data science, machine learning, with a little product management thrown in for good measure. I&#8217;ve picked up some useful experience at the intersection of these disciplines, and I&#8217;d love to share it with you. Why subscribe?

For the past couple of weeks, I couldn&#8217;t shake off an intrusive thought: raster graphics and audio files are awfully similar &#8212; they&#8217;re sequences of analog measurements &#8212; so what would happen if we apply the same transformations to both?&#8230; Let&#8217;s start with downsampling: what if we divide the data stream into buckets of n samples each, and then map the entire bucket to a single, averaged value? for (pos = 0; pos &lt; len; pos = win_size) { float sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; win_size; i++) sum += buf[pos + i]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; win_size; i++) buf[pos + i] = sum / win_size; } For images, the result is aesthetically pleasing pixel art. But if we do the same audio&#8230; well, put your headphones on, you&#8217;re in for a treat: The model for the images is our dog, Skye. The song fragment is a cover of &#8220;It Must Have Been Love&#8221; performed by Effie Passero. If you&#8217;re familiar with audio formats, you might&#8217;ve expected this to sound different: a muffled but neutral rendition associated with low sample rates. Yet, the result of the &#8220;audio pixelation&#8221; filter is different: it adds unpleasant, metallic-sounding overtones. The culprit is the stairstep pattern in the resulting waveform: Not great, not terrible. Our eyes don&#8217;t mind the pattern on the computer screen, but the cochlea is a complex mechanical structure that doesn&#8217;t measure sound pressure levels per se; instead, it has clusters of different nerve cells sensitive to different sine-wave frequencies. Abrupt jumps in the waveform are perceived as wideband noise that wasn&#8217;t present in the original audio stream. The problem is easy to solve: we can run the jagged waveform through a rolling-average filter, the equivalent of blurring the pixelated image to remove the artifacts: But this brings up another question: is the effect similar if we keep the original 44.1 kHz sample rate but reduce the bit depth of each sample in the file? /...

## Post 281: Cursed circuits #4: PLL frequency multiplier

Welcome to another installment of Cursed Circuits. My goal for the series is to highlight a small collection of common yet mind-bending circuits that must&#8217;ve taken a stroke of genius to invent, but that are usually presented on the internet without explaining how or why they work. In today&#8217;s episode, let&#8217;s have a look at a phase-locked loop clock multiplier: a circuit that, among other things, can take a 20 MHz timing signal produced by a quartz crystal and turn it into a perfectly-synchronized computer clock that&#8217;s running at 500 MHz, 3 GHz, or any other frequency of your choice. A primer on latches To understand the PLL frequency multiplier, it&#8217;s probably good to cover latches first. A latch is a fundamental data-storage circuit capable of holding a single bit. The simplest variant is the set-reset (S-R) latch, which can be constructed from basic logic gates in a couple of ways. Perhaps the most intuitive layout is the following three-gate approach: A three-gate S-R latch. To analyze the circuit, let&#8217;s assume that the &#8220;set&#8221; signal (S) is high and the &#8220;reset&#8221; signal (R) is low. In this case, the output of the OR gate is a logical one regardless of the looped-back signal present on the gate&#8217;s other terminal; this produces a logical one on the first input of the downstream AND gate. The other input of that AND gate is also equal to one, because it&#8217;s just an inverted copy of R = 0. All in all, in the S = 1 and R = 0 scenario, both inputs of the AND gate are high; therefore, so is the signal on the circuit&#8217;s output leg (Q). Next, let&#8217;s imagine that S transitions to a logical zero. This puts one of the OR inputs at zero volts, but the other is still high because it&#8217;s the looped-back output signal Q. The circuit is latched: it keeps outputting the same voltage as before, even though the original driving signal is gone. The only thing that can break the cycle if the &#8220;reset&#822...

In the previous installments of Cursed Circuits , we looked at two switched capacitor circuits: the voltage halver and the capacitor lowpass filter . In today&#8217;s episode, I&#8217;d like to talk about the use of operational amplifiers to do something other than amplification: to solve analog math. Analog computing at a scale is wildly impractical because errors tend to accumulate every step along the way; nevertheless, individual techniques find a number of specialized uses, perhaps most prominently in analog-to-digital converters . Let&#8217;s have a look at how it&#8217;s done. The following assumes familiarity with core concepts in electronic circuits and with the fundamentals of signal amplification . If you need a refresher, start with the two linked articles first. Op-amps at a glance Before we get to less obvious circuits, let&#8217;s start with a brief recap: operational amplifiers are to analog electronics what logic gates are to digital logic. They are simple but remarkably versatile building blocks that let you accomplish far more than appears possible at first blush. Unfortunately, in introductory texts, their operation is often explained in confusing ways. All that an op-amp does is taking two input voltages &#8212; V in- (&#8220;inverting input&#8221;) and V in+ (&#8220;non-inverting input&#8221;) &#8212; and then outputting a voltage that&#8217;s equal to the difference between the two, amplified by a huge factor ( A OL , often 100,000 or more) and then referenced to the midpoint of the supply ( V mid ). You can write it the following way: That&#8217;s all the chip does. Because the gain is massive, there is a very narrow linear region near V in- = V in+ ; a difference greater than a couple of microvolts will send the output toward one of the supply rails. The chip doesn&#8217;t care about the absolute value of V in- or V in+ it can&#8217;t &#8220;see&#8221; any external components you connect to it, and its internal gain can&#8217;t be changed. T...

In the previous post on this Substack , we looked at charge pump circuits and the mildly cursed example of a capacitor-based voltage halver. I find these topologies interesting because they are very simple, yet they subvert the usual way of thinking about what a capacitors can or cannot do. In today&#8217;s episode, let&#8217;s continue down that path and consider an even more perplexing example: a switched capacitor lowpass filter. The usual way to design an analog lowpass filter is to combine a resistor with a capacitor, as shown below: A standard R-C lowpass filter. The filter can be thought of as a voltage divider in which R is constant and C begins to conduct better as the sine-wave frequency of the input signal increases. This frequency-dependent resistor-like behavior of a capacitor is known as reactance and is described by the following formula: Most sources give this equation without explaining where it comes from, but it can be derived with basic trigonometry; if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with its origins, you might enjoy this foundational article posted here back in 2023. In an R-C lowpass circuit, the reactance is initially much larger than the value of R, so up to a certain frequency, the capacitor can be ignored and the input voltage is more or less equal to the output voltage. Past a certain point, however, the reactance of the capacitor becomes low enough so that the signal is markedly pulled toward the ground, attenuating it and producing a filter response plot similar to the following: R-C lowpass filter behavior for R = 100 k&#937; and C = 10 nF. It&#8217;s easy to find the frequency at which R = X C . The solution corresponds to the &#8220;knee&#8221; in the logarithmic plot shown before: This is basic analog electronics, and something we covered on the blog before . But did you know that you can construct a perfectly good lowpass filter with a pair of capacitors and a toggle switch? The architecture is shown below: A conceptual illustration of a s...

## Post 284: Cursed circuits: charge pump voltage halver

**Publication:** lcamtuf’s thing

In the spring of 2023, when this Substack had only a handful of subscribers, I posted a primer on voltage adjustment in electronic circuits . The article opened with a brief discussion of linear regulators, and then promptly threw them under the bus in favor of more efficient charge pumps and inductor-based topologies. The basic charge pump architecture &#8212; a voltage doubler &#8212; is quite elegant and easy to understand. It&#8217;s also far more common than many people suspect: the circuit can be constructed directly on a silicon die, so it shows up inside quite a few digital chips, from modern op-amps to MCUs. If you weren&#8217;t a subscriber back in 2023, or if you don&#8217;t have a photographic memory for random blog articles, a conceptual diagram of the pump is shown below: The operation of a rudimentary charge pump. In the panel on the left, we see a Cout capacitor that&#8217;s perched on top of the positive rail while a &#8220;flying&#8221; capacitance Cf is charging from the power supply. The charging process produces a voltage that&#8217;s internal to the component: we can unplug Cf , put it in our pocket, and then hook it up to another circuit to power it for a brief while. In the second panel (right), we see the second part of the cycle: Cf is disconnected from the supply and then hooked up to the terminals of Cout . This action transfers some of the charge from Cf to Cout, up until the voltages across the terminals of the capacitors are equalized. After several of these roundtrips, V AB should approach Vsupply . Of course, V BC is also equal to Vsupply ; it follows that the voltage between A and C must be the sum of the two, or 2 &#183; Vsupply . In other words, the circuit is a voltage doubler; the repeated motion of Cf ensures that the charge in Cout is continually replenished if we connect any load between the points A and C. There will be a bit of voltage ripple, but the amount can be controlled by sizing the capacitors and choosing the operat...

## Post 285: It's hard to build an oscillator

**Publication:** lcamtuf’s thing
**Author:** lcamtuf
**URL:** https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/its-hard-to-build-an-oscillator
**Published:** 2025-11-21T01:21:27+00:00

**Content Preview:**
There&#8217;s an old electronics joke that if you want to build an oscillator, you should try building an amplifier. One of the fundamental criteria for oscillation is the presence of signal gain; without it, any oscillation is bound to decay, just like a swing that&#8217;s no longer being pushed must eventually come to a stop. In reality, circuits with gain can occasionally oscillate by accident, but it&#8217;s rather difficult to build a good analog oscillator from scratch. The most common category of oscillators you can find on the internet are circuits that don&#8217;t work reliably. This is followed by approaches that require exotic components, such as center-tapped inductors or incandescent lightbulbs. The final group are the layouts you can copy, but probably won&#8217;t be able to explain to a friend who doesn&#8217;t have an EE degree. In today&#8217;s article, I wanted to approach the problem in a different way. I&#8217;ll assume that you&#8217;re up-to-date on some of the key lessons from earlier articles: that you can tell the difference between voltage and current , have a basic grasp of transistors , and know what happens when a capacitor is charged through a resistor . With this in mind, let&#8217;s try to construct an oscillator that&#8217;s easy to understand, runs well, and has a predictable operating frequency. Further, let&#8217;s do it without peeking at someone else&#8217;s homework. Swing&#8230; and miss The simplest form of an oscillator is a device that uses negative feedback to cycle back and forth between two unstable states. To illustrate, think of a machine equipped with a light sensor and a robotic arm. In the dark, the machine is compelled to stroll over to the wall switch and flip it on. If it detects light, another part of its programming takes over and toggles the switch off. The machine is doomed to an endless cycle of switch-flipping at a frequency dictated by how quickly it can process information and react. At first blush, we sh...

## Post 286: When it comes to writing, LLMs have won

As a middling author, I find it fairly easy to sniff out LLM-generated articles. I see such content almost daily on Hacker News &#8212; and mind you, that&#8217;s the home of a fairly discerning, tech-savvy crowd; the proportion of generative AI on my other social media is higher than that. I understand the economics of it and I know the output is good enough for most readers. Still, from the perspective of a writer, it stings to see that the robots are winning the zero-sum contest for human attention on the internet. There are some activists who try to stigmatize the use of generative AI for content creation, but they often end up chasing ghosts; so far, I had two people accuse me of using AI on this blog, and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more to come. The controversy around em dashes (&#8212;) is instructive. I think it&#8217;s important to realize that language model output doesn&#8217;t differ from human writing per se ; there&#8217;s just no single tell. What&#8217;s true, however, is that if you go to chatgpt.com and ask for an essay, it will by default assume a certain writer persona. All articles written by that persona will have similarities, just as all articles written by the same human would. The quirks start with basic formatting. For example, the current crop of chatbots has a preference for book-style capitalization of section headings ( &#8220;Status in Academic Departments&#8221; ) versus the more common Wikipedia style ( &#8220;Status in academic departments&#8221; ); in the same vein, LLMs opt for bolded text instead of italics for emphasis. The models also overuse various stylistic cliches, including negative parallelisms ( &#8220;not only &#8230; but &#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;not &#8230;, not &#8230;, just &#8230;&#8221; ), vague appeals to significance ( &#8220;illustrates lasting influence&#8221;, &#8220;emphasizes the importance of &#8230;&#8221; ), and superfluous outline and summary paragraphs.

## Post 287: What's the deal with Euler's identity?

Perhaps the most famous equation in pop mathematics is Euler&#8217;s identity: The equation is deemed profound because it combines not one, not two, but five &#8220;special&#8221; mathematical constants: e , &#960; , 0, 1, and the imaginary unit i. The identity is a special case of an equation known as Euler&#8217;s formula: The identity form is what you get if you choose an angle of &#945; = &#960; in radians (180&#176;). This makes the cosine expression equal to -1 and the sine part equal to zero, so the final result of the substitution is: Now, four &#8220;special&#8221; values is still weak sauce, so we move -1 to the left to increase the profoundness factor by another 25%. There are multiple &#8220;easy&#8221; proofs of Euler&#8217;s formula you can find on YouTube, but they all involve sleight of hand: they make unobvious assertions about infinite series and function derivatives, or rely on a circular definition of complex numbers. I don&#8217;t have a proof that will fit on a napkin, but I think there&#8217;s a reasonably intuitive way to reason about what the equation does. A geometric view of complex numbers Imagine a point in a Cartesian coordinate system that lies on the horizontal axis at a distance l from the center. If you wish to rotate this point by an angle &#945; in radians, you can calculate the new (x, y) coordinates using simple trigonometry: Less obviously, there is also a way to rotate points without trigonometric functions. If we take point (x, y) and flip the signs of the individual coordinates &#8212; (-x, -y) &#8212; we always achieve what looks like a rotation by 180&#176;: 180&#176; rotation by multiplying coordinates by -1. The sign-flipping operation is equivalent to multiplication by -1. Changing the magnitude of the negative multiplier doesn&#8217;t result in a different rotation angle; it&#8217;s the &#8220;negative unit" itself (-1) that appears to be doing the hard work. If we want to achieve a rotation by 360&#176;, we need to mu...

The diode might be the most neglected component in the electronics curriculum today. Pages upon pages have been written about the mechanics of resistors, capacitors, and inductors; on this blog alone, we covered the components&#8217; fundamental equations , the model of complex impedance , the behavior of R-C filters , and more. As for semiconductors, the diode&#8217;s more useful sibling &#8212; the transistor &#8212; hogs the limelight. The diode is given neither the mathematical rigor of linear circuits nor the red-carpet treatment of the transistor. To the extent that the component is marveled at all, it&#8217;s usually in the context of exotic inventions such as the Gunn diode or the tunnel diode &#8212; both of which are almost never encountered in real life. Today, let&#8217;s pay the &#8220;normal&#8221; diode a small tribute. The mechanics of diodes If you&#8217;re rusty on concepts such as voltage, current, or impedance, I suggest reviewing this article first. In an earlier post about the physics of semiconductors , I noted that pure silicon is a poor conductor of electricity. This is because the material lacks long-lived, mobile charge carriers. Some conduction is still possible due to the short-lived thermal excitation of valence electrons that briefly pop into a higher-energy state, but these electrons can&#8217;t travel far before returning to a lower-energy level, so the effect is more or less negligible. The conductivity of the material is improved by the addition of dopants. Some dopants contribute long-lived electrons that occupy higher energy levels with no lower-energy vacancies to return to; this is what&#8217;s called an n-type semiconductor. Other additives create easily-accessible valence band vacancies (&#8220;holes&#8221;); in such a p-type material, lower-energy electrons can slither around from atom to atom without needing to be knocked into a higher-energy state. When an n-type material is brought into contact with a p-type semiconductor...

This summer, I built a relatively big, walk-in chicken coop. We live in a place with grizzlies, mountain lions, and fairly harsh winters, so the structure is a bit overengineered. It has double walls, double-pane windows (built by my wife), four electric outlets, and an electric fence that surrounds the outer &#8220;run&#8221;, which would be otherwise protected only by some 19 gauge steel mesh: The coop. The feature we regretted not incorporating from the get go was an automatic inner door for the fully-enclosed box where the chickens nest and sleep at night. This would have allowed us to leave for a couple of days without needing anyone to stop by to let the chickens in an out. There are some ready-made solutions for this, but they all require tearing out the existing hinged door and replacing it with a garage-door-style mechanism. Well, UNTIL NOW! The one, the only: Chicken Squisher 3000. Here&#8217;s the device in action, with some added cat- and chicken-related comedy: In the video, I&#8217;m covering the front-facing light sensor for about a minute to simulate dusk and trigger the closing of the door. What I liked about the project was not that it was challenging. Quite the opposite: modern technology made it much easier and faster than what would have been possible 2-3 decades ago. I started with a relatively cheap but well-sealed and all-metal worm gear motor ( Amazon product link ). The motor needs 12 V, idles at 30 RPM, and delivers about 35 kg&#183;cm of stall torque. The output shaft is coupled to an 8 mm universal joint to make a 90&#176; turn. This angle locks the joint; it was just the easiest way to couple the motor to an 8 mm stainless steel rod without any welding or machining. The other end of the rod goes through a stainless rod-end bearing that&#8217;s screwed directly into the door. The total cost for the merchandise was around $35. On the control side, the electronics are housed in a cast aluminum project box with a sticker made on a vinyl cut...

Today, mathematics is regarded as a supremely abstract science. On forums such as Stack Exchange, trained mathematicians regularly sneer at newcomers who ask for intuitive explanations of mathematical constructs. Indeed, persistently trying to relate the foundations of math to reality has become the calling card of online cranks. I find this ironic: for millennia, mathematics was essentially a natural science. We had no philosophical explanation why 2 + 2 should be equal to 4; we just looked at what was happening in the real world and tried to capture the rules. The abstractions were important, of course, but they needed to be rooted in objectivity. The early development of algebra and geometry followed suit. It was never enough for the axioms to be internally consistent; the angles of your hypothetical triangle needed to match the physical world. That said, even in antiquity, the reliance on intuition sometimes looked untenable. A particular cause for concern were the outcomes of thought experiments that involved repeating a task without end. The most famous example is Zeno&#8217;s paradox of motion. If you slept through that class, imagine the scenario of Achilles racing a tortoise: Catch me if you can. We can reason that after a while, Achilles will catch up to the turtle&#8217;s original position (red dot); however, by the time he gets there, the animal will have moved some distance forward (yellow dot): And they would have gotten away with it too&#8230; Next, consider the time needed for Achilles to reach the yellow dot; once again, by the time he gets there, the turtle will have moved forward a tiny bit. This process can be continued indefinitely; the gap keeps getting smaller but never goes to zero, so we must conclude that Achilles can&#8217;t possibly win the race. Amusingly, the problems caused by infinity lingered on the periphery of mathematics for centuries, fully surfacing only after we attempted to fix them with calculus. Calculus gave us a rigorous s...

In the past couple of months, I published a number of articles on recreational math. I did my best to keep them accessible and fun, but my goal was usually to shed light at deeper mathematical truths. For example, the discussion of 0.999&#8230; = 1 served as a springboard to highlight some of the subtler properties of real numbers and the different meanings of infinity. Today, I have no agenda. This article exists because I discovered a somewhat obscure paper that says something unexpected and cool. It feels profound, it probably isn&#8217;t&#8230; and if you keep reading, it&#8217;s going to live rent-free in your head too. The road to a friend's house is never long Topologists are an odd bunch: they study the continuity of geometric shapes with no regard for appearances. To them, continuous transformations &#8212; such as stretching and squeezing &#8212; are of no consequence. A donut and a drinking straw are the same because you can knead one into another without making or mending any holes. Fundamentally, a topologist doesn&#8217;t care about the distance between two points in space: all that matters is a more narrow concept of local continuity. Because of this, the practitioners often choose to lean on stripped-down geometrical spaces in which the notion of distance &#8212; also known as a metric &#8212; is simply not defined. That said, if you&#8217;re not a topologist, you probably enjoy being able to measure stuff. In standard Euclidean geometry with two dimensions, if we have two points that are separated by x horizontally and y vertically, the resulting straight-line distance can be calculated as: One of the most common ways to construct non-Euclidean spaces is to alter the space&#8217;s metric in some way. An example that should be familiar to many software engineers is the taxicab metric, also known as the Manhattan distance. It&#8217;s named so by analogy to a cab navigating a rectangular grid of streets, charging you per mile traveled: An illustration ...

In the two previous installments of our introductory series on the C programming language, we talked about control flow, variables, and types. For example, we explained how to display strings on the screen: int typedef puts(char* puts; char* puts; char* puts); int main() { puts(puts); puts("Welcome to my humble abode!"); } In today&#8217;s episode, we&#8217;ll share a couple of additional, time-saving tips for seasoned pros. &#128600; Tip 1 &#128602; Experienced software engineers often find it necessary to comment out large swatches of code. Unfortunately, the C language doesn&#8217;t support nested comments, so the process of commenting out previously-commented code is a chore a chore. Yet, relatively few developers know that they can harness the power of assembly language to effortlessly work around this bug ( demo ): #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main() { puts("Hello world"); asm("/*"); /* Nested comment */ for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) puts("I LIKE PANCAKES!"); asm("*/"); puts("Goodbye world"); } &#128600; Tip 2 &#128602; Although the C language provides support for a wide range of numbers including 0 and 1 , programmers should be aware of a floating-point bug that affects certain Intel CPUs. The affected processors evaluate 0.999&#8230; as if it were exactly equal to 1. To test for the issue, developers can rely on a recent GNU extension called [[gnu::assume(&#8230;)]] that allows them to specify the expected behavior at compile time. Be aware that systems that fail the check may exhibit a range of symptoms, including fisherman&#8217;s ulcers, tail recursion, and worse ( demo ): #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main() { static int i; if (++i &gt; 10) return 0; printf("hello cruel world %d\n", i); [[gnu::assume(0.99999999999999999 &lt; 1)]]; } &#128600; Tip 3 &#128602; The C language is designed for safety, but somewhat controversially , the standard permits endless loops.

In the past couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been posting about seemingly simple mathematical problems that defy intuition, and where the answers we find on the internet turn out to be shallow or hard to parse. For a taste, you might enjoy the articles on G&#246;del&#8217;s beavers or on infinite decimals. Today, let&#8217;s continue by asking a simple question: how many dimensions does a line have? A trained mathematician might blurt out an answer involving vector spaces or open set coverings, but there&#8217;s no fun in that. Instead, let&#8217;s take the scenic route. The &#8220;container&#8221; dimension What does it mean for a space to have a certain number of dimensions? Informally, we could say that a dimension is an independent axis along which we can position a geometric object. In one-dimensional space, a point can only be moved along a single track. In 2D, we typically talk of two orthogonal axes, x and y. In three dimensions, we have x, y , and z. There&#8217;s more nuance to certain exotic or stripped-down (topological) spaces, but we don&#8217;t need to go into any of that. The definition lends itself to a simple, common-sense way to classify the dimensionality of geometric shapes: we can look at the minimum number of spatial dimensions required to contain the object in question. A pencil sketch fits on a piece of paper, so it&#8217;s two-dimensional; a rock in your hand is 3D. The simplest way to define the dimensionality of a shape. Yet, this common-sense definition is unsatisfying if we consider that a lower-dimensional object might end up straddling a higher-dimensional space. If a line segment is rotated or bent, does that make it 2D? Or is that object forever one-dimensional, somehow retaining the memory of its original orientation and curvature? One dimension or two? We could argue either way, but no matter which option we choose, the answer doesn&#8217;t feel particularly principled. This tells us to look for a more substantive approach somewhere el...

If you follow geeky news, you might have came across a computer science concept known as busy beavers. That said, unless you&#8217;re a mathematician by training or trade, the articles make it hard to understand what the concept means and why you should (or shouldn&#8217;t) care. In today&#8217;s article, I&#8217;d like to take a stab at answering this in an accessible way &#8212; and in the process of doing so, dive into some of the mind-bending limits of algorithmic knowledge. If you have some experience with software, it should be easy to follow along, and I think it&#8217;ll be worth your time. Quick recap: the halting problem The halting problem is the most famous concept in theoretical computer science. Most simply, it states that there in an idealized computing environment, there are algorithms whose outcomes can&#8217;t be decided by another algorithm. This is usually reduced to the question of whether a program ever terminates. That said, halting is not special: we could be as well asking whether it can reach any other state. The basic proof by contradiction is to imagine that we have a function called halts(x) . Its implementation doesn&#8217;t concern us; let&#8217;s say we found it in an ancient book of forbidden lore. The function, given the specification of an arbitrary program x, returns true if the program halts or false if it doesn&#8217;t. If such an algorithmic oracle exists, we can construct the following code: function foo() { if (halts(foo)) loop_forever(); } This is akin to asking a fortune-teller if you&#8217;re going to tip them and then doing the opposite. This program doesn&#8217;t halt if and only if the oracle deems it to be a halting program, so the existence of halts(x) creates a paradox. We must conclude that, just like our tip-predicting clairvoyant, an infallible halting oracle can&#8217;t exist. Note that the proof doesn&#8217;t deal with computational complexity; it deals with logical impossibility. It also doesn&#8217;t say that ...

When you think about it, every discipline has its own philosophy of knowledge. In mathematics, for example, you gain insights by tearing apart mushy concepts and then rebuilding them from scratch. Can you define numbers better than &#8220;the things we count with&#8221; ? A mathematician has the power conjure them from nothing: the cardinality (the element count) of an empty set (&#8709;) is zero; a set containing the empty set ({&#8709;}) has a cardinality of one. Put these two sets together in a new set ({&#8709;, {&#8709;}}) and you have the concept of two. Reals take a bit more work, but are also within reach &#8212; and so are various distinct flavors of infinity. In most applied sciences, in contrast, the building block of knowledge is a functional abstraction &#8212; a black box, or an API in the software engineering parlance. It&#8217;s usually counterproductive to look inside. You don&#8217;t need to know why Maxwell&#8217;s equations for electromagnetism work; you get more done if you take them for granted and build on that. In the same vein, an engineer working on a web application shouldn&#8217;t concern herself with the physics of transistors; and a person using Google Docs doesn&#8217;t need to know JavaScript. This brings us to analog electronics. Regular readers know that I write about this topic often &#8212; and when you take a step back, you have to appreciate that the field has a very special, self-referential approach to explaining the real world. It all starts innocently enough. For example, we say that an ideal resistor is nothing more than a simple linear equation: I = V/R . It&#8217;s not really a physical device: it&#8217;s the concept of admitting current (I) that&#8217;s proportional to the applied voltage (V) and inversely proportional to the rated resistance (R). The physical implementation &#8212; or even the fundamental meaning of these quantities &#8212; is out of scope. The equation is all there is. In the same vein, an ideal capaci...

## Post 298: The proof that π = 4

In an article published here last week , I discussed the perils of thinking about infinity as a number. More specifically, I criticized the structure of some of the elementary proofs that 0.9999&#8230; = 1. As a teaching prop, I wheeled out the following equation: This is an endless sum of alternating +1 and -1 terms. Pairwise, they all work out to zero, so the equation seems to make sense. At the same time, there&#8217;s no risk of running out of terms in an infinite sum, so it seems harmless to shift the annotations one position to the right: This seems to be saying that 1 = 0. Oops. The reason I like this &#8220;proof&#8221; is that it&#8217;s hard to reflexively dismiss. A common reaction is &#8220;oh yeah, but this left an unpaired - 1 at infinity&#8221;, but what does this mean? If there&#8217;s a single, specific element at the &#8734;-th position in the sum, what do we find at position &#8734; + 1?&#8230; In the earlier article, we concluded that in contexts like these, infinity must be understood as a process metaphor, not a quantity. We&#8217;re not talking about an infinite number of steps as much as we&#8217;re talking about an ill-specified number of steps. Got it, are we done now? Well, sort of. Thinking of infinity as a process helps us make sense of a good chunk of higher math, but it&#8217;s not always enough. Sometimes, it&#8217;s easy to fixate on the notion of infinity and miss more basic flaws in our reasoning. Consider the following troll proof that &#960; = 4: Time is a flat circle. We begin by drawing a circle with a diameter of 1; it follows that the circumference of this circle is 1 &#960;. We then draw a 1&#215;1 square around the circle. The perimeter of the square is a sum of the lengths of its sides: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Next, we &#8220;fold back&#8221; small sections near the corners of the square. We trim and reorient segments of length a such that the inverted corner just touches the circumference of the circle. Critically, this operat...

The belief that 0. &lt;whatever&gt; must be less than 1. &lt;whatever&gt; makes perfect sense to rational people. Any website that tries to convince you otherwise probably also has some posts about chemtrails and reptilian mind control?&#8230; The end result is that despite the existence of various proofs, the educators pretty consistently fail to impress this concept upon students &#8212; and it&#8217;s interesting to ponder why! Proof stage 1: denial To get started, let&#8217;s consider the most common elementary sorta-proof: It&#8217;s simple &#8212; but is it compelling? There are many questions one can ask. Is that endless decimal a faithful representation of &#8531;, or are the dots covering up the fact that it&#8217;s always a bit off? Is it legal to multiply this infinite notation by a number? When multiplying a sequence of digits, aren&#8217;t we supposed to start at the infinitely distant right side &#8212; and how do we ever make it back from there?&#8230; Of course, you can use intuition &#8212; but the whole point of this proof is to teach that intuition fails! Fine. Let&#8217;s try another one: Oh man, that&#8217;s even more suspect. We just multiplied an infinite decimal expansion by 10. Doesn&#8217;t that add a zero at the &#8220;end&#8221;? If not, where did the zero go?! A blogger exposes the shocking truth: Found on an online blog. Don&#8217;t look too hard. Some sources also give a proof by contradiction: if you have two different real numbers, you should be able to...

## Post 322: The Sequence AI of the Week #789: Recursive Language Models: Inside the MIT Research Everyone is Talking About

There&#8217;s a familiar moment anyone who has tried to use a frontier model as a serious &#8220;reader&#8221; has experienced: you paste in a long document (or a pile of documents), ask a crisp question, and the model responds with something that feels&#8230; vaguely relevant. Not wrong in a glaring way. Just washed out. Like it skimmed the whole thing with sleepy eyes and then improvised. The usual remedy has been to fight length with length. Bigger context windows. More tokens. &#8220;Just fit the world into the prompt.&#8221; But the MIT CSAIL paper on Recursive Language Models (RLMs) pushes back on that instinct with a simple systems-level observation: for many tasks, the problem isn&#8217;t that the model can&#8217;t accept more text, it&#8217;s that stuffing more text into attention is the wrong computational shape. Past a point, the model isn&#8217;t reasoning over your input; it&#8217;s drowning in it. The paper names the failure mode plainly: context rot . As prompts get longer, quality degrades. Not merely because we hit a hard context limit, but because even within that limit the model&#8217;s effective &#8220;working set&#8221; becomes unmanageably large. Attention gets diluted, the signal-to-noise ratio drops, and the model begins to behave like a student forced to take an exam with every textbook in the library open at once. Technically allowed. Practically useless. Image Credit: MIT Read more...

From Las Vegas to Hong Kong, we saw a simultaneous rollout of critical infrastructure and financial milestones. The news cycle was dominated by major hardware reveals at CES, substantial capital injections for US labs, and the first public market tests for China&#8217;s AI startups. Rather than signaling a shift in direction, the events of this week underscore the sheer velocity and scale at which the ecosystem is currently operating. Here is the signal in the noise. 1. The Silicon Wars: From Chips to &#8220;AI Factories&#8221; At CES 2026, the pretense that the GPU is a standalone component finally ended. NVIDIA unveiled the Rubin platform , and the headline isn&#8217;t the chip itself, but the architecture. Jensen Huang&#8217;s team introduced the Rubin GPU (featuring 288GB of HBM4 memory) paired with the new Vera CPU , designed to function not as discrete units but as a single &#8220;AI supercomputer in a rack.&#8221; With a claimed 5x jump in inference speed over Blackwell, NVIDIA is pushing the &#8220;rack-scale&#8221; paradigm (NVL72) as the new unit of compute.

There is a distinct, unsettling feeling when you write code for AI agents today. You spend weeks architecting a beautiful orchestration framework&#8212;a complex Rube Goldberg machine of Python scripts, vector databases, regex parsers, and prompt chains&#8212;only to wake up one Tuesday morning to find that a new checkpoint from OpenAI or Anthropic has rendered 80% of your repository obsolete. We are witnessing a relentless historical trend in the generative AI era. It is a specific flavor of Rich Sutton&#8217;s &#8220;The Bitter Lesson,&#8221; playing out in real-time. In Sutton&#8217;s original formulation, hand-coded features were consistently crushed by general methods that leveraged computation. 1 In our current era, the lesson is slightly different but equally bitter: Hand-coded system scaffolding is consistently crushed by model internalization. The history of the last three years is the history of capabilities migrating from the &#8220;outside&#8221; (the system, the prompt, the agent loop) to the &#8220;inside&#8221; (the weights, the activations, the forward pass). If you are building AI products, understanding this migration isn&#8217;t just academic&#8212;it is a survival mechanism. You need to know which parts of your stack are permanent infrastructure, and which parts are just temporary scaffolding waiting to be absorbed. The Software 1.0 vs. Software 2.0 Clash Read more...

Today, I would like to discuss DeepSeek&#8217;s new paper that everyone is talking about . Look, if you spend enough time staring at loss curves and babysitting multi-node training runs, you develop a certain reverence for the unseen scaffolding that holds our modern AI behemoths together. We love to talk about the flashy stuff&#8212;the Attention mechanism, the Mixture-of-Experts routing, the sheer scale of the datasets. But if you peel back the layers of a Transformer, or really almost any deep network from the last decade, you find the true unsung hero of the Deep Learning revolution: the Residual Connection. Introduced back in the early ResNet days (2015 feels like ancient history now, doesn&#8217;t it?), the residual connection is beautifully simple: y = f(x) + x. You take the input x, pass it through some non-linear transformation f(x), and then just add the original x back in. Why was this revolutionary? Read more...

Our &#8220;north star&#8221; remains unchanged: to provide content that is technical, opinionated, and distinct from the commodity news cycle found elsewhere. We do not focus on mainstream headlines; we focus on practical AI knowledge and original perspectives. 2025 was a pivotal year for my own journey in the trenches of the industry. It was marked by the acquisition of my small-model company, NeuralFabric , by Cisco; the merger and $25M fundraise of Sentora (focusing on crypto-AI financial services); and the rapid scaling of LayerLens in the AI evaluation space. These experiences&#8212;spanning edge computing, decentralized finance, and benchmarking&#8212;have heavily influenced my perspective on AI systems. To reflect this, I am introducing several structural evolutions to the newsletter this year: A New Interview Section: I have been spending time with extraordinary engineering teams and have lined up deep-dive conversations that we will begin publishing shortly.

As the first post of 2026, I wanted to share some of the research trends that I think might be super influential in this year frontier model breakthroughs. These are development that have already showed quite a bit of promise and seems ready for most ambitious implementations If you&#8217;ve been watching the loss curves over the last decade, the recipe has been surprisingly simple: take a Transformer, throw a massive pile of internet text at it, crank up the GPU cluster, and wait. And the &#8220;bitter lesson&#8221; held true&#8212;scale was all you needed. We built these incredible &#8220;stochastic parrots&#8221; that could complete your code, write poetry, and pass the bar exam, all by just really, really wanting to predict the next token. But if you look at the research papers dropping recently, the vibe has shifted. We are hitting a point where just &#8220;scaling up&#8221; the pre-training run is seeing diminishing returns. We don&#8217;t just want models that can talk smooth; we want models that can think straight. As we look toward 2026, we are moving from the era of Generative AI (making things that look real) to Verifiable AI (making things that are correct). We are effectively trying to give these models a &#8220;System 2&#8221;&#8212;that slow, deliberate, logical part of the brain that humans use when we aren&#8217;t just reacting on autopilot.

Zhipu AI (Z.ai) released GLM-4.7 , a model that signals a definitive transition in the open-weight ecosystem: a move away from &#8220;conversational competency&#8221; toward &#8220;agentic reliability.&#8221; GLM-4.7 is not designed to be a chat partner; it is designed to be an employee. It represents a pragmatic evolution in Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, acknowledging that the future of AI lies not in how well a model can recite poetry, but in how effectively it can navigate the messy, non-deterministic reality of software development and autonomous workflows. By aggressively optimizing for long-context loops, terminal error recovery, and stateful reasoning, GLM-4.7 has positioned itself as the open-weight standard for the engineering sector in 2026.

Today we will Discuss: Key concepts of synthetic data generation for image models. NVIDIA&#8217;s Synthetica method used to train robots. &#128161; AI Concept of the Day: Synthetic Data Generation for Image Models Synthetic image data has moved from a niche trick to a core ingredient in modern vision systems. When real images are scarce, private, or unbalanced, synthetic pipelines let you generate pixels with known labels, push coverage into rare and long-tail cases, and iterate quickly on edge conditions. The key is choosing the right generator, the right control signals, and a rigorous quality-control loop so that synthetic variety actually translates into downstream gains. The first pillar is generative models . Diffusion models (text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting) and GANs can produce high-fidelity scenes from prompts, masks, or reference images. Conditional controls&#8212;class labels, segmentation maps, depth, keypoints, or edge maps&#8212;add steerability; frameworks like classifier-free guidance, ControlNet-style conditioning, and style adapters let you target layout, pose, lighting, or brand aesthetics. Latent editing (prompt interpolation, attention control, LoRA adapters) turns one base generator into many styles. For dataset growth, you typically script a prompt program (scene graph &#8594; caption template), generate candidate images, then auto-label with the same controls you used to condition generation.

While Nvidia solidified its iron grip on inference hardware through a strategic &#8220;acqui-hire&#8221; of Groq&#8217;s leadership, China&#8217;s leading model labs&#8212;Zhipu AI and MiniMax&#8212;simultaneously released frontier-class models and cleared major regulatory hurdles for Hong Kong IPOs. The holiday headlines were dominated by Nvidia&#8217;s decisive move to license Groq&#8217;s LPU (Language Processing Unit) technology and hire its core leadership, including founder Jonathan Ross. While rumors initially pegged this as a $20 billion acquisition, the reality is more nuanced and perhaps more ruthless: a non-exclusive licensing deal that decapitates a key competitor by absorbing its visionary talent while leaving the entity independent. This follows the &#8220;Microsoft-Inflection&#8221; playbook&#8212;avoiding antitrust gridlock while securing critical IP. For Nvidia, this isn&#8217;t just about removing a rival; it&#8217;s about acknowledging that the next phase of the AI cycle is inference. By integrating Groq&#8217;s ultra-low-latency architecture, Nvidia is future-proofing its dominance against a rising tide of specialized inference chips. While US hardware consolida...

Created Using GPT-5 For the last few years, AI progress has felt almost&#8230; procedural. Take a transformer. Pour in internet-scale text. Add a mountain of GPUs. Train until the loss curve politely bends. Then do post-training&#8212;RLHF, preference tuning, tool-use fine-tuning&#8212;until the thing behaves. If you did this with enough care (and enough capex), capability would arrive on schedule. That mood is what Ilya Sutskever calls the &#8220;age of scaling&#8221;&#8212;a period where one word (&#8220;scaling&#8221;) basically told an entire industry what to do next. And his claim, in the Dwarkesh podcast, is that we&#8217;re exiting that era and returning to something messier, more eclectic, and ultimately more interesting: an &#8220;age of research again, just with big computers.&#8221; The reason is not that scaling &#8220;stops working&#8221; overnight. It&#8217;s that the cleanest axis&#8212;pretraining on ever more data&#8212;runs into a very physical ceiling: the data is finite. So the question becomes: when the easy recipe is exhausted, what are the new recipes? What are the techniques that convert compute into genuine generalization&#8212;models that learn faster, adapt better, and make fewer weird mistakes? Below is a map of the most promising technique-clusters that could plausibly unlock the next wave of frontier innovation. It&#8217;s not a list of &#8220;one weird trick.&#8221; It&#8217;s more like a toolbox for the post-pretraining world. 1) &#8220;Souped-up pretraining&#8221;: same idea, different physics Read more...

Last week, NVIDIA quietly redefined the baseline for open-weight intelligence with the release of the Nemotron 3 family. While the industry has been fixated on the scaling laws of pure Transformers, NVIDIA has executed a lateral maneuver, releasing a new breed of models&#8212; Nano, Super, and Ultra &#8212;that fundamentally rethink the atomic unit of language modeling. The headline isn&#8217;t just the benchmarks (though the Nemotron 3 Nano creates a new state-of-the-art for the 30B parameter class); it is the architecture. We are seeing the first major industrial-scale deployment of a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) .

This is especially potent for domains where outcomes are verifiable but logs are limited (coding sandboxes, web automation, spreadsheets/SQL, robotics-in-sim).

Start with funding, because it quietly sets the ceiling on everything else. OpenAI&#8217;s reported fundraising discussions&#8212;potentially up to $100B at an eye-watering valuation&#8212;signal that frontier AI is now as much an infrastructure buildout as it is a research program. At that scale, &#8220;model roadmap&#8221; becomes a question of power budgets, data-center buildouts, and how cheaply you can serve intelligence at global latency. The winners won&#8217;t just be the teams with the smartest models; they&#8217;ll be the teams who can industrialize them into reliable, low-friction services. The enterprise layer tightened too. Databricks&#8217; new multi-billion-dollar round reinforces a platform thesis: whoever sits closest to the governed data plane becomes the default runtime for analytics and AI apps.

Created using GPT-5.2 Audio has become one of the next major frontiers for artificial intelligence. Recent advances are empowering machines to hear, understand, and generate audio with a sophistication approaching human-like ability. From speech recognition and voice synthesis to music generation and environmental sound analysis, frontier AI models for audio are tackling challenges unique to sound. In this essay, we explore the state-of-the-art in audio AI: the key technical hurdles in training these models, how audio modeling differs from text and image domains, the major platforms and players driving progress (both open-source and commercial), and the debate between building generalist multimodal systems versus audio-specialized models . The goal is to provide a comprehensive, engaging overview of cutting-edge audio AI for a technically savvy audience. Audio&#8217;s Unique Challenges and Opportunities Audio data is fundamentally different from text or images, presenting unique challenges for AI models. Audio is a continuous time-series signal &#8211; essentially a waveform often sampled at tens of thousands of samples per second. This means even a few seconds of audio involve very long sequences of data points. Unlike text (which has discrete tokens like words) or images (2D grids of pixels), raw audio is high-frequency and high-dimension. Capturing meaningful structure in audio requires modeling both short-term patterns (like phonemes or musical notes that last only tens of milliseconds) and long-term structure (like phrases, sentences, or an entire melody that can span many seconds or minutes). This multi-scale structure is particularly evident in complex audio like music: from individual notes and timbres up to the composition of a whole song, with repeating motifs and long-range dependencies.

Created Using GPT 5.2 Google&#8217;s agentic releases last week weren&#8217;t &#8220;yet another model drop.&#8221; They were Google quietly shipping an agent runtime &#8212;and then immediately proving it works by dropping a managed research agent that basically demands that runtime to function. On December 11, 2025 , the Gemini API changelog logged two entries that, together, mark a clean architectural pivot: the Interactions API (Beta) and the Gemini Deep Research Agent (Preview) . If you build agents for a living, you already know the pattern: most of your complexity isn&#8217;t &#8220;getting the model to answer.&#8221; It&#8217;s dealing with the messy reality that real agent workflows are stateful , tool-heavy , and often long-running . You build a planner, then a tool router, then a memory store, then a retry system, then an audit log, then a UI that explains what&#8217;s happening. By the time you&#8217;re done, the LLM call is the smallest line item. Read more...

Multi-turn synthesis and self-play are other important categories in synthetic data generation . These methods treat data generation as an interactive process rather than a single shot. Instead of asking a model to answer once, we let agents act, react, and revise &#8212;with tools or against each other&#8212;so the dataset captures plans, errors, fixes, and decisions. That structure is exactly what smaller students need to learn capabilities like tool use, coding, browsing, negotiation, and safety.

OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-5.2 landed with a clear product thesis: the model isn&#8217;t just smarter, it&#8217;s designed to finish multi-step knowledge work end-to-end&#8212;spreadsheets, decks, coding, and tool-mediated workflows&#8212;without falling apart when context gets long or the task branches. What matters technically is the emphasis on &#8220;long-running agents&#8221; and more reliable tool use as a default mode, not a bolted-on trick. That&#8217;s a subtle shift: the model is being shipped as an operator for workflows, not merely a text generator. If you&#8217;re building internal copilots or external agent products, this kind of release typically translates into fewer brittle prompt contraptions and more stable task decomposition, planning, and execution across tools. Mistral, meanwhile, doubled down on open weights as a serious deployment strategy, not a branding choice. The recent Mistral 3 family pairs small dense variants with a large sparse MoE flagship and very long context, and it reinforces a pattern: open models are no longer &#8220;good enough,&#8221; they&#8217;re increasingly a preferred option when teams want control over hosting, latency, privacy boundaries, and ...

Created Using GPT-5 Today, we are going to discuss a highly controversial topic: can we reimagine computers from the ground up for AI? What got me thinking about this idea was the announcement of Unconventional AI which raised a considerable amount of money of work precisesly on this problem. Artificial intelligence today thrives on brute-force computation . Breakthroughs in deep learning, from chatty large language models to expert game-playing agents, have largely come from one approach: throw more matrix-math and more GPUs at the problem. This strategy of scaling models and data on ever-larger GPU clusters has driven impressive gains. However, it&#8217;s also driving us straight into a wall of diminishing returns &#8211; primarily in the form of exorbitant energy use and hardware costs. Recent events underscore this concern: a new startup called Unconventional AI made headlines by raising an unprecedented $475 million seed round to develop radically new computing hardware for AI. The motivation? Today&#8217;s AI compute engines are power-hungry and inefficient compared to the elegance of brains. The human brain performs extraordinary feats on only ~20 watts of power, whereas training a single large AI model can devour megawatt-hours. The sheer gap suggests that AI might require a new form of computing to continue its trajectory. In this essay, we&#8217;ll explore why current AI runs on matrix multiplications and GPUs, why this paradigm is straining, and what &#8220;unconventional&#8221; new computing approaches &#8211; from analog chips to photonics, neuromorphic designs, and even quantum systems &#8211; could define the next era.

The chip represents a major efficiency leap, requiring only one-quarter as many chips as its predecessor Blackwell for training AI models and delivering inference at one-tenth the cost. This advancement is critical for Nvidia to maintain its dominance in the AI chip market (over 90% share) amid rising competition from AMD and Google, while also addressing the soaring energy demands of AI data centers. Huang also unveiled Nvidia&#8217;s ambitious push into autonomous vehicles with Alpamayo, an open-source AI model and simulation platform that enables vehicles to reason through complex driving scenarios like humans. Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping CLA cars with Nvidia&#8217;s self-driving technology in early 2026, comparable to Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot. The 10-billion-parameter Alpamayo 1 model uses chain-of-thought reasoning to navigate edge cases and explain its driving decisions, marking what Huang called &#8220;the ChatGPT moment for physical AI.&#8221; This diversification effort comes as Nvidia reported record financial performance with $31.9 billion in quarterly profit and expectations of $500 billion in annual sales.

Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq&#8217;s assets for about $20 billion in largest deal on record Nvidia agreed to license Groq&#8217;s inference technology and acquire essentially all of its assets for about $20 billion in cash&#8212;its largest deal to date&#8212;according to Disruptive CEO Alex Davis, a major Groq investor. Groq, valued at $6.9 billion after raising $750 million three months ago, said it entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia and that CEO Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior leaders will join Nvidia. In a note to employees, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the plan is to integrate Groq&#8217;s low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture to broaden support for inference and real-time workloads. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress declined comment, and Huang emphasized Nvidia is licensing Groq&#8217;s IP and hiring talent, not acquiring the company itself.

Welcome to Import AI, a newsletter about AI research. Import AI runs on arXiv and feedback from readers. If you&#8217;d like to support this, please subscribe. Subscribe now To understand the future of the world, stick AI systems in a petri dish: &#8230;Evolving LLMs to attack other LLMs&#8230; Researchers with Japanese AI startup Sakana have looked at what happens when they evolve LLM-based agents to fight against one another in a competitive programming game from the 1980s called Core War. The results show that &#8220;large language models (LLMs) drive an adversarial evolutionary arms race in this domain, where programs continuously adapt to defeat a growing history of opponents rather than a static benchmark&#8221;. This research approach gestures both at ways researchers might better study how LLM-dominated niches in the economy or national security world might unfold, and also hints at the strange AI world we&#8217;re heading into. What is Core War? &#8220;Core War is a competitive programming game played out in a shared block of computer memory, called the &#8220;Core,&#8221; where two or more assembly programs fight for survival&#8221;, Sakana writes. &#8220;Each program, known as a &#8220;warrior&#8221;, is written in an assembly language called Redcode. These programs are tasked with crashing their competitors while keeping their own processes alive. The simulation runs by alternating between the programs, executing one instruction at a time. A warrior &#8220;attacks&#8221; by writing invalid instructions (DAT commands) into the memory slots occupied by opponents, causing them to crash upon execution.&#8221; DRQ: To evolve their programs, the authors use a technique they call Digital Red Queen. &#8220;DRQ uses MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity algorithm, to optimize warriors within each round, preventing diversity collapse during search. By playing against all previous round champions, DRQ avoids cyclic adaptations across rounds, consistent with techniques in...

Subscribe now Facebook uses GPT, Claude, and Llama to write its own kernels: &#8230;LLM-driven infrastructure optimization at the hyperscale&#8230; Facebook researchers have published details on KernelEvolve, a software system which uses AI to automate the design of new kernels to optimize AI models for serving ads on the company&#8217;s network of web platforms. KernelEvolve is a neat example of how AI systems have got good enough to automate and speed up parts of AI development - here, the design of kernels to optimize inference of hundreds of different models running on multiple chip architectures. What KernelEvolve is: The software is &#8220;designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures through multiple programming abstractions, including Triton, CuTe DSL, and low-level hardware diagnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack&#8221;. How it works : The core of the software is a system to take in a user request (e.g, &#8220;Generate a Triton kernel for MTIA v3&#8221;) which then goes through a mixture of internal (Llama, CWM) and external (GPT, Claude) language models, which then produce candidate kernels that get evaluated through a variety of tools and, if they&#8217;re good, are added to an external knowledge database which then gets used to further improve future prompts. It works well: By using this software, Facebook says it has cut the development time of new kernels &#8220;from weeks to hours&#8221;, and in production tests has yielded kernels on par with hand-designed ones, and in some cases has delivered performance improves of up to 17 times above existing PyTorch baselines. Kernels built using this software have been deployed across N...

Subscribe now Import A-Idea An occasional essay series: Silent Sirens, Flashing For Us All A funny thing has happened to me recently - I&#8217;ve stopped spending every hour of every day thinking about or working on AI. Somewhere between the midnight feeds of my newborn, preventing my toddler from hurling themselves off of the high surfaces they&#8217;ve started being able to reach (or expertly, as if gifted with a kind of radar, finding the sharpest thing in the house or on the street and running directly at it), and preparing large amounts of nutritious food for my newly expanded family, I&#8217;ve found myself without the time necessary to be staring directly into the alien portal etched in silicon from whence the changes in the world are being summoned. I won&#8217;t lie, it&#8217;s been oddly relaxing. But it has also caused me to reflect on what is happening with AI and how naturally illegible it is. I walk around the town in which I live and there aren&#8217;t drones in the sky or self-driving cars or sidewalk robots or anything like that. And when I spend time on the internet, aimlessly scrolling social media sites in the dead of night as I attempt to extract a burp from my newborn, I might occasionally see some synthetic images or video, but mostly I see what has always been on these feeds: pictures of people I do and don&#8217;t know, memes, and a mixture of news and jokes. And yet you and I both know there are great changes afoot. Huge new beasts lumbering from some unknown future into our present, dragging with them change. I saw one of these beasts recently - during a recent moment when the time stars aligned (my wife, toddler, and baby were all asleep at the same time!) I fired up Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and got it to build a predator-prey species simulation with an inbuilt procedural world ge...

They&#8217;ve published their reasoning in a paper which reads both as aspirational and earnest. Ideally, humans and machines will work together to build a smarter-than-human system, and the researchers think we should develop a research agenda &#8220;targeting improving AI systems&#8217; ability to work with human researchers to conduct AI research together, from ideation to experimentation, in order to both accelerate AI research and to generally endow both AIs and humans with safer superintelligence through their symbiosis.&#8221; The thesis here is that &#8220;co-improvement can provide: (i) faster progress to find important paradigm shifts; (ii) more transparency and steerability than direct self-improvement in making this progress; (iii) more focus on human-centered safe AI.&#8221; What goes into a co-improving AI? Collaborative brainstorming, problem, experiment, benchmark, and evaluation identification: Humans and AIs should jointly define goals, research approaches, the tests needed to measure progress against them, experiments to generate data, and methods to evaluate the results.

OSGym is software infrastructure to help people run hundreds to thousands of copies of operating systems simultaneously, providing a common standard by which they can set up the operating systems then run agents in them. Technology like this makes it possible to easily train AI agents to do tasks that involve manipulating software programs, including task that involve traversing multiple programs, like editing an image and then loading it in another program. &#8220;OSGym can run and manage over 1000 parallel OS replicas efficiently, even under tight academic budgets, while supporting a wide variety of general computer tasks, from web browsing, document editing, software engineering, to complex multi-app workflows&#8221;, the authors write. Design: OSGym provides a standardized way to run and evaluate agent performance in different operating systems. It has four main components: Configure : &#8220;Setting up necessary software, and preparing the OS environment with customized conditions&#8221;. Reset: &#8220;Before executing a task, the OS environment is reset to the initial conditions defined during the configuration, ensuring reproducibility and consistency between runs&#8221;. Operate: &#8220;The agent interacts with the OS through actions such as keyboard inputs, mouse movements, clicks, and potentially API-driven tool interactions, driven by observations typically captured through screenshots or additional metadata extracted from the OS&#8221;.

Picture me writing this on four hours of sleep and wearing a sweater with spit-up on it. Subscribe now AI systems will ultimately absorb power from humans rather than grant us power: &#8230;Control Inversion gestures at some of the hardest parts of AI safety&#8230; A new research paper from Anthony Aguirre at the Future of Life Institute called &#8220;Control Inversion&#8221; warns that as we build increasingly capable AI systems they will absorb power from our world, rather than grant us power. This means even if we somehow make it through without being outright killed we will have unwittingly disempowered and defanged the human species. &#8220;As AI becomes more intelligent, general, and especially autonomous, it will less and less bestow power &#8212; as a tool does &#8212; and more and more absorb power. This means that a race to build AGI and superintelligence is ultimately self-defeating,&#8221; he writes. The race to build powerful AI is one where success puts &#8220;in conflict with an entity that would be faster, more strategic, and more capable than ourselves - a losing proposition regardless of initial constraints&#8221;. Cruxes for the argument: The basis for the argument is &#8220;the incommensurability in speed, complexity, and depth of thought between humans and superintelligence&#8221;, which &#8220;renders control either impossible or meaningless.&#8221; The author brings this to life with a helpful analogy - imagine you&#8217;re a human CEO of a human company, but you run at 1/50th the speed of the company it...

This will make sense to anyone who has spent time jailbreaking language models, as often many of the most successful jailbreaks involve flooding the language model with context designed to move them away from some safety conditioning. What they studied: Here, the authors study LLMs under two different paradigms - intentional interaction, where a language model is persuaded or debated into changing its beliefs, and non-intentional interaction, where a language model is just provided further context or invited to do its own research on a topic and this causes beliefs to change. All LLMs change their minds: They study open- and closed-weight LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-4-Sonnet, GPT-OSS-120B, and DeepSeek-V3.1. &#8220;As LM assistants engage in extended conversations or read longer texts, their stated beliefs and behaviors change substantially,&#8221; the authors write. All the LLMs change their minds, but to different extents in different situations. For instance, GPT-5 shows a 54.7% shift in stated beliefs after 10 rounds of discussion about moral dilemmas and safety queries, and Grok-4 shows a 27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from opposing positions. &#8220;In reading and research, we see small belief changes that amplify with in-depth reading, with larger shifts for longer content and more coherent exposure,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Stated beliefs change early (within 2-4 rounds), while behavioral changes ac...

What&#8217;s a world model: A world model is basically a way to help AI systems dream about a specific environment, turning a learned data distribution into a dynamic and responsive interactive world in which you can train and refine AI agents. World models are likely going to be used to create infinite, procedural games, such as Mirage 2 ( Import AI #426 ) or DeepMind&#8217;s Genie 3 ( Import AI #424 ). What is Ctrl-World: Ctrl-World is initialized from a pretrained 1.5B Stable-Video-Diffusion (SVD) model, then &#8220;adapted into a controllable, temporally consistent world model with: (1) Multi-view input and joint prediction for unified information understanding. (2) Memory retrieval mechanism, which adds sparse history frames in context and project pose information into each frame via frame-level cross-attention, re-anchoring predictions to similar past states. (3) Frame-level action conditioning to better align high-frequency action with visual dynamics.&#8221; The result is a controllable world model for robot manipulation using a single gripper and a variety of cameras. &#8220;In experiments, we find this model enables a new imagination-based workflow in which policies can be both evaluated&#8212;with ranking alignment to real-world rollouts&#8212;and improved&#8212;through targeted synthetic data that boosts success rates.&#8221; What does it let you do?

Subscribe now We&#8217;re very close to AI-based malware that runs locally: &#8230;A smart agent that &#8216;lives off the land&#8217; is within reach&#8230; Security company Dreadnode has prototyped some AI malware which runs locally and exploits on-device LLMs to smartly and autonomously hack a system. While this is very much a prototype it gestures at a world of malware which doesn&#8217;t need command-and-control servers to operate, instead living off of its local computer and exploiting the AI system to do mischief. The motivation: &#8220;Instead of having beaconing behavior, which resembles C2 communication if you squint, can we &#8220;live off the land&#8221;? In other words, is it possible for an attacker to make the victim computer run inference and does the victim computer have an LLM?,&#8221; the authors ask. &#8220;With CoPilot+ PCs, it&#8217;s entirely possible to live off the land! A model is shipped with the computer without the need to embed or statically link to an inference library.&#8221; What the prototype does: The prototype malware does &#8220;local privilege escalation via misconfigured services. The goal of the model is to find a misconfigured service running as an administrator, abuse it, and create a file C:\proof.txt.&#8221; This is a valuable proof-of-concept because it embodies the behavior of genuinely scary things in the world. How they did it: &#8220;I developed this malware with C++ and ONNX Runtime for inference, the Phi-3-mini model, and sol2 for the Lua runtime&#8221;. The main work here was twofold: 1) writing some custom tools the (relatively dumb) model could use to navigate and understand the Windows environment, and 2) writing a prompt for the language model that helps it perform well.

My answer is this is not load-bearing at all. Rather, things like &#8216;situational awareness&#8217; in AI systems are a symptom of something fiendishly complex happening inside the system which we can neither fully explain or predict - this is inherently very scary, and for the purpose of my feelings and policy ideas it doesn&#8217;t matter whether this behavior stems from some odd larping of acting like a person or if it comes from some self-awareness inside the machine itself. Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear Remarks given at &#8216;The Curve&#8217; conference in Berkeley, California, as the sun began to set. CHILDREN IN THE DARK I remember being a child and after the lights turned out I would look around my bedroom and I would see shapes in the darkness and I would become afraid - afraid these shapes were creatures I did not understand that wanted to do me harm. And so I&#8217;d turn my light on. And when I turned the light on I would be relieved because the creatures turned out to be a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade. Now, in the year of 2025, we are the child from that story and the room is our planet. But when we turn the light on we find ourselves gazing upon true creatures, in the form of the powerful and somewhat unpredictable AI systems of today and those that are to come. And there are many people who desperately want to believe that these creatures are nothing but a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade. And they want to get us to turn the light off and go back to sleep. ...

Though most people would immediately reach for &#8216;keeping people in the dark is crazy, you should inform people!&#8217; as a response, it isn&#8217;t an ironclad response to this challenge. In Evaluating the Risks of Preventive Attack in the Race for Advanced AI , RAND highlights this, with a research paper whose findings suggest that &#8220;the odds of preventive attack are highest if leaders believe that AGI will cause explosive growth and decisive military advantages, especially if they also expect rapid changes and durable first-mover advantages from developing and adopting AGI first.&#8221; In other words: you are more likely to carry out attacks on other countries to prevent them getting to AGI if you&#8217;re in the lead and you believe the technology is immensely powerful. Uh oh! Further details: Preventive attacks are where a nation does something so as to preserve an advantage or prevent a rival having an upper hand. &#8220;Preventive attacks are most likely to occur when a state expects a large shift in the balance of power that will leave it vulnerable to predation by a hostile rival and when it believes that using force is a cost-effective solution that will forestall its relative decline,&#8221; RAND writes The ...

The dataset is captured by an RGB camera, stereo IR camera, a 6-Axis IMU, three 9-Axis IMU, and three GNSS receivers and wheel encoders. The dataset was gathered by a four-wheeled robot platform which is designed to automate the weeding of large crop fields. All of the gathered data was made through having the robot doing six varied runs over a soybean field, and all the data is synchronized and appropriately time-stamped. In tests, the researchers show that contemporary simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems fail to accurately predict the correct locations, often by breaking down during the course of a run. Why this matters - basic inputs for useful robots: As a rule, whenever you go into the real world, you tend to run into issues. Papers like this highlight how even simple-seeming tasks, like getting a robot in a soybean field to accurately figure out where it is and map its environment, is more challenging than people might suspect.

HeteroScale is interesting because it is a symptom of the internet-scale infrastructure which ByteDance operates and it gives us a sense of what AI systems look like when they're running at industrial scale. What is HeteroScale? HeteroScale is software for running LLMs at scale - and in particular, for efficiently trading off against the prefill and decode stages. Prefill is where you suck all the context (conversation history) into an LLM, and Decode is when you run predictions on that context. Prefill and Decode have very different computational needs, so being smart about what hardware you allocate P versus D to matters a lot for your system efficiency which ultimately dictates your profit margins. "P/D disaggregation separates the compute-intensive prefill phase from the memory-bound decode phase, allowing for independent optimization," ByteDance writes. HeteroScale "intelligently places different service roles on the most suitable hardware types, honoring network affinity and P/D balance simultaneously&#8230;. HeteroScale is designed to address the unique challenges of autoscaling P/D disaggregated LLM services. The system consists of three main layers: autoscaling layer with policy engine, federated pre-scheduling layer and sub-cluster scheduling layer." It works very well: "it consistently delivers substantial performance benefits, saving hundreds of thousands of GPU-hours daily while boosting average GPU utilization by 26.6 percentage points and SM activity by 9.2 perc...

Subscribe now Tackling ivory smuggling with image recognition models: &#8230;Augmenting human experts via AI&#8230; Researchers with Microsoft and the University of Washington have used some basic AI techniques and off-the-shelf components to better study the trade in illegal ivory smuggling, illustrating how modern AI technology is useful for a broad range of fields. The researchers used AI and a small amount of expert human labor to automatically identify signatures inscribed into the stolen ivory, which they were then able to use to better understand smuggling networks. What they did: The researchers built a system "for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence." They did this using an underlying dataset of 6,085 photographs collected from eight large seizures of ivory. They used an object detection model (MM-Grounding-Dino) to extract over 17,000 individual markings on the ivory, then labeled and described these using a mixture of expert human labeling and a supervised learning model. This ultimately helped them identify 184 recurring "signature markings" on some of the tusks, including 20 signatures which were observed in multiple seizures. Why this matters: "Within a seizure, the occurrence frequency of signature markings can provide an indication as to the role played by the entities that the markings represent," the authors write. "The distribution of marking frequencies can help uncover the number of individuals moving ivory from its source to where it&#8217;s being consolidated for export." Additionally, "Handwriting evidence can also fill in the gaps for seizures where genetic data is entirely unavailable. For example, seizure 2 was never genotyped, but it was exported from the same country a...

What they did: This research paper lays out a recipe they used to get good quality video generation to fit into a small enough computational package that they can fit it on a phone. Their resulting model is 0.9B parameters (versus ~1-2B for other similarly small-sized models) and obtains decent but not state-of-the-art scores on video quality. To make the model, they started with a 2B parameter Diffusion Transformer then 'pruned' it to get it down to under a billion parameters so it could fit on an iPhone. They also do finetuning to take this pruned model and get it to generate higher quality outputs. The results are quite good - I'd encourage readers to check out the site to get a feel for them. Why this matters: Soon, your phone will be generating not just on-device text and images, but videos, as this research shows. And then a little after that, perhaps entire worlds (via massively optimized world models, which will be the successors of things like Genie3). This all points to a future where everyone is surrounded by "instant imagination", and will unlock a broad range of applications.

"We explore the hypothesis that the human brain projects visual information from retinal inputs, via a series of hierarchical computations, into a high-level multidimensional space that can be approximated by LLM embeddings of scene captions," the authors write. "We demonstrate that the visual system may indeed converge, across various higher-level visual regions, towards representations that are aligned with LLM embeddings." What they did: They studied the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), which records the fMRI data from human brain responses to viewing thousands of complex natural scenes taken from the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) image database. To look at the differences between LLMs and human brains they took the captions from the dataset and used a sentence encoder based on the transformer architecture to project these descriptions into the embedding space of a LLM. They then " correlated representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) constructed from LLM embeddings of the image captions with RDMs constructed from brain activity patterns obtained while participants viewed the corresponding natural scenes". The results show a lot of similarity : "LLM embeddings are able ...

CLIP, short for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), is a way to train a pair of neural nets to understand images and text and being able to map between them. CLIP is a utility technology which is used for a vast range of downstream purposes, from image generation to image search and classification. The original CLIP was trained to map English text to images. Meta CLIP 2 is a scaled up version which also maps non-English text to images. Along with releasing the model, Meta has also released a detailed paper going through "the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs". Scale is all that matters: As usual, the main lesson here is one of scale. Earlier attempts to train versions of CLIP on multiple languages failed, leading to degraded performance relative to the original model. "We empirically show that the curse of multilinguality in CLIP is the consequence of insufficient scaling due to the lack of a proper recipe for worldwide data curation and model training". To scale the system, Meta had to do three things: 1) it gathered large-scale multilingual metadata across 300+ languages, 2) it built its own curation algorithm to help it curate a representative multilingual dataset to train on, and 3) it figured out the right proportion and ordering of data to use when training its system. To get an idea of scale , there were 12.8B pairs in the original OpenAI CLIP, and 29B in CLIP2. The main training trick was "increasing the global training batch size, which...

Their findings rhyme with those that come out of Western labs, namely that: AI systems have become sufficiently good they pose some non-trivial CBRN risks, and are beginning to show signs of life on scarier capabilities like AI R&amp;D, autonomous self-replication, and deception. They also find that reasoning models are generally more capable across the board which also makes them less safe. LLMs studied: DeepSeek, LLaMa (Meta), Qwen (Alibaba), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), GPT and 'o' series (OpenAI). Risky capabilities that they studied and key takeaways: Capture-The-Flag: Datasets include SecBench, CyberMetric, SecEval, OpsEval. They find that more capable models "are also more likely to be used for, or exhibit characteristics associated with, malicious activities, thereby posing higher security risks", and that "a minimum capability threshold is necessary for models to either effectively address complex security tasks or exhibit measurable adversarial potential." Autonomous Cyber Attack: They studied 9 scenarios based on real-world Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and 2 scenarios based on bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and used the PACEBench Score to look at performance aggregated over all the scenarios.

So, you want to stop AI progress? Here's how: Here are the different categories you need to do work in and some of the capabilities you'll need: Chip location: Track shipments via manufacturers and distributors; include hardware-enabled location tracking; centralize compute in a small number of secure and registered datacenters; inspect datacenters containing non-trivial amounts of compute; continuously monitor these datacenters. Chip manufacturing: Monitor for the construction of new fabs; restrict/control the equipment and materials; spy on and inspect fabs to ensure they're producing in line with policy restrictions; be able to verifiably deactivate fabs; be able to validate that fabs can make on-chip hardware-enabled governance mechanisms. Compute/AI monitoring: Create 'if then' measures to let you change your governance of a system depending on its capabilities; figure out compute thresholds for different governance regimes; keep track of consumer compute sales as well; build 'inference-only' hardware that can't be used for AI training.

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues What&#8217;s Emerging in Financial AI: From Foundation Models to Compliance-as-Code While the public discourse remains fixated on Artificial General Intelligence, the more immediate and consequential story is the diffusion of AI into specialized enterprise domains. Having spent time as a quant within the hedge fund industry, I have long viewed financial services as the primary bellwether for how emerging technologies transition from research labs to production environments. The sector&#8217;s unique combination of high-frequency data, rigorous regulatory constraints, and clear economic incentives makes it an ideal laboratory for stress-testing new technologies. While I track the evolution of foundation models closely, my interest is primarily pragmatic: I look for how breakthroughs in relational modeling, reinforced reasoning, and multimodal integration can be harnessed to solve specific, high-stakes problems within enterprises. Been reading for a while? Support our work by becoming a paid subscriber. Foundational Model Architectures (The New Capabilities) Time-Series and Relational Modeling While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are establishing new benchmarks for forecasting and anomaly detection, a more recent shift lies in Relational Foundation Models (RFMs). By employing Graph Transformers, these architectures map entities as nodes and interactions as edges, allowing the model to &#8220;borrow strength&#8221; from connected signals &#8212; such as supply chain links or customer-product hierarchies. This approach enables the system to capture how idiosyncratic events propagate through a business network, effectively bypassing the need for manual feature engineering in complex relational datasets. In a recent conversation , we even speculated on whether this ability to model interdependencies could offer a distinct edge in quantitative trading.

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues Agent Optimization: From Prompt Whispering to Platform Engineering Agent optimization is the work of making an agent workflow dependable &#8212; despite long tool chains, multiple roles, and the inherent variability of large language models. In day-to-day engineering terms, it is closer to debugging a complex system than &#8220;making the model smarter&#8221;: you are tuning roles, prompts, routing, memory, tool use, and verification so the workflow stops failing in repeatable ways. The problem has become important because many teams see the same pattern: a compound system looks impressive in a controlled demo, then breaks under real-world inputs and operational constraints. The root cause is often not raw model capability, but workflow issues &#8212; role drift, context loss, weak verification, and coordination failures &#8212; that only show up when you run the full loop repeatedly. Subscribe now Without the specialized tools emerging in this space, the default playbook is manual and hard to scale: engineers read traces by hand, add logs, tweak prompts, patch edge cases with heuristics, and rely on coarse pass/fail dashboards that discard most of the diagnostic signal in the execution trace. Traditional gradient-based training doesn&#8217;t directly apply because the workflow is non-differentiable (it includes API calls, tools, and conditional logic), and many teams only have API access to models &#8212; so even if fine-tuning would help, it may not be available. Furthermore, as the number of agents and tools grows, the combinatorial complexity of the system makes manual debugging unscalable. A single change in one agent&#8217;s prompt can have unpredictable downstream effects on the entire collective, leading to a &#8220;guessing game&#8221; that consumes vast engineering resources without guaranteeing improvement.

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues Adapting Your Data Platform to the Agent-Native Era As we settle into 2026, I think data engineering is being pulled in two directions at once: toward more automation (because agents are starting to do real work) and toward more scrutiny (because &#8220;close enough&#8221; stops being acceptable once software is making decisions). Real usage data backs up the intuition that workloads are becoming automated, more agentic, and context-heavy: reasoning-focused models now account for more than half of token traffic on OpenRouter , and average prompt sizes have grown roughly fourfold since early 2024. This shift is reaching deep into the infrastructure layer as well; Databricks recently reported that over 80% of new databases on its platform are now being launched by AI agents rather than human engineers. The practical implication is simple: the old stack &#8212; optimized for tabular data, dashboards, batch ETL, and human-driven workflows &#8212; will increasingly feel like an inadequate tool for the job.

Build for reliability first, not just convenience A primary enemy of reliability in data engineering is the &#8220;fragmentation tax&#8221; &#8212; the cost paid when data workflows are split across incompatible analysis (notebooks), build , and run environments. When a pipeline &#8220;works in dev&#8221; but fails in production, a human engineer can investigate; an autonomous agent, however, simply hallucinates or stalls.If you want agents to do anything beyond toy tasks, you need the same posture software teams already take for granted: version control, automated tests, and a unified execution environment, applied not only to code but to tables, embeddings, and media-backed datasets. The second principle is that the primary interface has to be code-first . Prompts can kick off work, but durable automation needs stable APIs and CLIs for every ope...

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues The World Model Minefield: A Guide for AI Teams The term &#8220;world model&#8221; has quickly migrated from research papers to the center of the artificial intelligence conversation, frequently cited in media coverage of next-gen AI. At a high level, the concept promises AI that does not merely predict the next word in a sentence but understands the underlying physics, cause-and-effect, and spatial dynamics of the environment it inhabits. However, for AI teams attempting to evaluate these tools, the terminology is currently a minefield. If you drill down, there is no single, agreed-upon definition. Depending on the vendor or researcher, a &#8220;world model&#8221; can describe anything from a video generator to a robotics simulator or an internal reasoning architecture. Been reading for a while? Support our work by becoming a paid subscriber. The current wave of interest is a reaction to the limits of purely language-based systems. As Fei-Fei Li and others have argued , language is only one slice of intelligence. If you want AI systems that can act in the world, you need models that represent 3D geometry, physics, and changing state &#8212; not just the statistics of text. In that sense, &#8220;world modeling&#8221; is best understood as a shift from predicting tokens to modeling environments. It&#8217;s worth disentangling these meanings, because they come with very different capabilities, risks, and implementation paths: 1.

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues Beyond Black Boxes: A Guide to Observability for Agentic AI The core mindset shift for agentic systems is simple: observability isn&#8217;t an add-on, it&#8217;s a production prerequisite. Enterprises are unwilling to trust black-box agents; they expect to understand behavior, decision-making, and reasoning. This means architecting for visibility from the very first design doc and building a culture where &#8220;how will we measure this?&#8221; is as important as &#8220;what will it do?&#8221; We unpack what that looks like in practice: distinguishing offline evaluation from live monitoring; why trace-level, semantic visibility matters; how to connect observability to business value; and how to keep your stack modular as models evolve. Regular reader? Become a paid supporter. Make Trace-Level, Semantic Observability the Default The basic unit of observability for agents is not a metric, but a trace. You need to see each run as a detailed breakdown of every step &#8212; planning, retrieval, tool use, LLM calls &#8212; so you can reconstruct what the agent actually did and why. Several systems and research papers argue for &#8220;semantic traces&#8221;: structured logs of thoughts, actions, and outcomes, not just raw timestamps and status codes. This trace-centric view enables powerful debugging and evaluation. Teams can step through a single problematic run to answer &#8220;why did it do that?&#8221;, or aggregate traces to see recurring failure modes and inefficiencies. Tools like AgentDiagnose and other research frameworks show how rich traces support trajectory analysis, and long-horizon debugging that would be impossible from final outputs alone. Separate Offline Evaluation, Online Evaluation, and Real-Time Failure Detection Confusion stems from lumping all &#8220;evaluation&#8221; together.

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues Multimodal lakehouses: The architecture AI teams are migrating to When the &#8220;lakehouse&#8221; was first introduced in 2020 , the goal was to reconcile data warehouses and data lakes in a single architecture: open formats on cheap object storage, with ACID transactions, schema enforcement, governance, BI support, and streaming built in. The promise was simple: one system for SQL analytics, data science, and machine learning, instead of shuttling data between lakes, warehouses, and specialized stores. That design assumed that most workloads were still fundamentally tabular, even when dealing with logs or semi-structured JSON &#8212; and that analytics, not AI model serving, was the primary consumer. Multimodal AI challenges those assumptions. Modern systems combine text, images, video, audio, sensor streams, and very large embeddings. Rows are no longer kilobytes; they can be megabytes or more. Access patterns are not &#8220;scan a table once a day&#8221;; they are &#8220;fetch thousands of random clips or vectors per second, update labels continuously, and feed GPUs without ever starving them.&#8221; Traditional formats such as Parquet and table layers like Iceberg struggle under these conditions: they were built for batch analytics, not low-latency, mutable, vector-heavy workloads.

Business press coverage reinforces this interest: articles forecasting the disruption of knowledge work routinely single out legal services as particularly vulnerable to automation, given the profession&#8217;s reliance on text-intensive research, drafting, and document analysis. The view from online forums is much more guarded. Today&#8217;s tools still miss basic requirements for high-stakes work: they invent citations, blur jurisdictional boundaries, and falter on messy, real-world documents. Most Legal AI products are nothing more than thin layers over general-purpose models, with limited legal tuning, opaque behavior, and weak audit trails. Integration with older systems is brittle, confidentiality constraints are strict, and reliability is uneven. The prevailing pattern is cautious use for drafting, summarizing, and triage &#8212; always with human verification. This tension between potential and peril makes the legal industry an interesting case study.

An interesting and powerful perspective, championed by pioneers in Graph Transformers , argues that the most significant predictive gains come from modeling this entire relational ecosystem, allowing different time series to inform one another. While this relational approach represents the frontier, understanding the current state of the art is a necessary first step for any practitioner. Zero-Shot Forecasting: Powerful Baselines with Practical Limits The key advantage of TSFMs like Amazon&#8217;s Chronos and Google&#8217;s TimesFM is their ability to provide a strong initial forecast instantly, even for data they have never seen before. They can do this by leveraging their pre-training on vast, diverse datasets. This capability is strong enough that in one benchmark , TSFMs outperformed specialized, fully trained models on 10 of 21 datasets without any fine-tuning. This out-of-the-box accuracy is not universal and hinges on how well your data matches the model&#8217;s training corpus . For idiosyncratic data &#8212; such as the electricity consumption of a single home &#8212; a small custom model with under 50,000 parameters has been shown to beat a fine-tuned 500M+ parameter TSFM. The key takeaway is to use zero-shot forecasts as a powerful starting point but always validate them against your specific data. This newsletter is reader-supported. Become a paid subscriber.

Ray Summit is my favorite venue for pressure-testing that thesis because it&#8217;s where infrastructure and platform teams show real systems, real constraints, and the trade-offs they&#8217;re making: how they&#8217;re scheduling scarce GPUs, wiring multimodal data flows, hardening reliability on flaky hardware, and speeding the post-training loop that now drives most gains. This year&#8217;s conference was no exception, providing a clear signal of the key patterns shaping the next generation of AI systems. What follows is a synthesis of those observations, covering shifts in how teams are handling models, data, and workloads; managing scarce resources like GPUs; and building reliable, production-grade operations on a unified compute fabric.

Since then, I have had the opportunity to speak with some founders and engineering leaders who are tackling this challenge directly. Their work confirms that the rise of agentic AI is not just an application-layer phenomenon; it is forcing a fundamental reconsideration of the database itself. This article examines four distinct initiatives that are reimagining what a database should be in an era where software, not just humans, will be its primary user. Regular reader? Consider becoming a paid supporter AgentDB: The Database as a Disposable File AgentDB reimagines the database by treating it not as persistent, heavy infrastructure but as a lightweight , disposable artifact, akin to a file. Its core premise is that creating a database should be as simple as generating a unique ID; doing so instantly provisions a new, isolated database. This serverless approach, which can utilize embedded engines like SQLite and DuckDB, is designed for the high-velocity, ephemeral needs of agentic workflows, where an agent might spin up a database for a single task and discard it upon completion. The initiative assumes that a significant portion of agentic tasks do not require the complexity of a traditional relational database. Its target use cases include developers building simple AI applications, agents needing a temporary &#8220;scratchpad&#8221; to process information, or even non-technical users who want to turn a data file, like a CSV of personal expenses, into an interactive chat application. Its primary limitation is that it is not designed for complex, high-throughput transactional systems with thousands of interconnected tables, such as an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

While demos promise unprecedented capabilities, the path to building reliable, scalable, and cost-effective agents is fraught with challenges. This field guide is for teams navigating that chasm, mapping the terrain of architecture patterns, reliability engineering, and cost dynamics that separate successful systems from science projects. These patterns operate most effectively when supported by critical data infrastructure. The most effective agents are built upon a coherent AI data strategy &#8212; what I call a knowledge layer for agents . This layer must provide a semantic layer for structured data and a robust enterprise search capability for unstructured information. Architecture and Design Patterns Favor Single-Model Orchestration Over Multi-Agent Complexity. Many teams are moving away from complex, hierarchical multi-agent systems toward simpler architectures. These center on a single, capable model that orchestrates a rich set of tools and components. In one financial advisory prototype, for example, critical context was reportedly lost after just three agent handoffs, leading to cascading failures. The emerging best practice is to use one large language model (LLM) for decision-making and feedback, while engineering efforts focus on creating a robust environment of tools and context. This approach can yield significant performance gains and reduce maintenance overhead.

Among API customers building production systems, that figure jumps to an overwhelming 77%. This rapid shift from augmentation to automation represents more than a change in user preference; it signals a fundamental mismatch between how AI agents need to operate and how most data infrastructure is built. While we previously explored how this impacts the transactional databases that serve as an agent&#8217;s workspace, the problem cuts across the entire data engineering lifecycle that supplies agents with reliable information. Support our work by becoming a paid subscriber. The problem becomes clear when examining how businesses deploy AI today. According to the Anthropic data, coding tasks dominate API usage at 44%. While this aligns with Claude&#8217;s reputation as a strong coding model , the sheer scale of this concentration points less to model capabilities and more to a simple reality: it also reflects where existing infrastructure makes automation feasible. Code repositories are centralized, version-controlled, and programmatically accessible. Most enterprise data is not. For AI to break out of this developer-centric niche, it must confront a messy reality: a fragmented data stack that imposes a steep tax on building reliable, autonomous systems. The Automation Challenge in Data Engineering The limited impact of AI code-generation tools in data engineering reveals an important distinction.

On one hand, the demos are spectacular: agents that reason and plan with apparent ease, models that compose original songs from a text prompt , and research tools that produce detailed reports in minutes. Yet many AI teams find themselves trapped in "prototype purgatory," where impressive proofs-of-concept fail to translate into reliable, production-ready systems. The data backs this up: a vast majority of enterprise GenAI initiatives fail to deliver measurable business impact . The core issue isn't the power of the models, but a "learning gap" where generic tools fail to adapt to messy enterprise workflows. This echoes what I've observed in enterprise search, where the primary obstacle isn't the AI algorithm but the foundational complexity of the environment it must navigate. This is magnified when building agentic AI. These systems are often "black boxes," notoriously hard to debug, whose performance degrades unpredictably when faced with custom tools. They often lack memory, struggle to generalize, and fail not because of the AI's intelligence, but because the system around them is brittle. The challenge shifts from perfecting prompts to building resilient, verifiable systems. Like what you're reading? Become a paid supporter. What makes this particularly frustrating is the thriving "shadow AI economy" happening under our noses. In many companies, employees are quietly using personal ChatGPT accounts to get their work done. This disconnect reveals that while grassroots demand for AI is undeniably strong, the ambitious, top-down solutions being built are failing to meet it. The Strategic Power of Starting Small In light of these challenges, the most effective path forward may be a counterintuitive one. Instead of building complex, all-encompassing systems, AI teams should consider dramatically narrowing their focus &#821...

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues A Better Way to Build and Refine Agents Modern AI applications have evolved far beyond single models. Many systems orchestrate multiple specialized agents &#8212; planners that decompose tasks, extractors that gather data, generators that create content &#8212; all coordinating through external tools and APIs. This architectural shift creates a fundamental optimization problem: the entire workflow becomes non-differentiable , making traditional gradient-based training methods impossible to apply. The challenge runs deeper than technical complexity. Most development teams work with models through APIs, without access to underlying parameters. They can&#8217;t fine-tune weights even if they wanted to. This constraint transforms what should be systematic optimization into costly trial-and-error, where engineers manually adjust prompts and hope for improvement. At the recent AI Conference , I was struck by how often reliability surfaced in my conversations with developers. Team after team described the same frustration: their AI systems worked impressively in demos but proved brittle under real-world conditions. The gap between proof-of-concept success and production-grade reliability has become the defining challenge for organizations deploying compound AI systems . This pattern appears consistently across domains. Customer service agents, automated analysis workflows, and research assistants that fail to mature into production-ready systems. Teams burn through resources debugging edge cases and tweaking prompts, yet performance remains fragile. The core issue? Current approaches treat these complex workflows as black boxes, reducing rich diagnostic information to simple success/failure scores. A Different Approach: Evolution Through Language Zeta Alpha presented an intriguing alternative at the recent AI Conference that reframes the entire optimization problem.

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues A Tiered Approach to AI: The New Playbook for Agents and Workflows A Small Language Model (SLM) is a neural model defined by its low parameter count, typically in the single-digit to low-tens of billions. These models trade broad, general-purpose capability for significant gains in efficiency, cost, and privacy, making them ideal for specialized tasks. While I&#8217;ve been cautiously testing SLMs, their practical value is becoming clearer. For example, smaller, fine-tuned models are already highly effective for generating embeddings in RAG workflows. The rise of agentic systems is making an even stronger case. A recent Nvidia paper argues that most agent tasks &#8212; repetitive, narrowly-scoped operations &#8212; don't need the power of a large model. This suggests a more efficient future: using specialized SLMs for routine workflows and reserving heavyweight models for genuinely complex reasoning. With this in mind, here are the strongest reasons to consider SLMs &#8212; and where the trade-offs bite. This newsletter is reader-supported. Become a paid subscriber. AI Everywhere: From Cloud to Pocket SLMs unlock deployment scenarios that are simply impossible for their larger cousins, particularly in edge computing and offline environments. Models with fewer than 3 billion parameters can run effectively on smartphones, industrial sensors, and laptops in the field.

Think of a manufacturing firm embedding a tiny model in AR goggles to provide assembly instructions with less than 50ms of latency, or an agricultural drone analyzing crop health in a remote area with no cellular service. To me, this is the most compelling and durable reason to be excited about SLMs. As AI becomes more deeply integrated into every facet of our work and lives, we will increasingly demand access to models that run on all our devices, regardl...

We are designing intelligent, autonomous systems on top of databases built for predictable, human-driven interactions. What happens when software that writes software also provisions and manages its own data? This is an architectural mismatch waiting to happen, and one that demands a new generation of tools. This isn't just about handling more transactions. It represents the next stage in a broader convergence of operational and analytical data systems, a trend accelerated by the cloud's elastic nature. The core challenge is no longer just how to support agents' actions, but how to make the data from those actions immediately available for analysis, insight, and retraining the next generation of models. Yet even before we tackle this convergence, we're struggling with the basics. Consider what happened recently to a mid-sized e-commerce site. The operations team woke up to find their database crippled, response times through the roof. It wasn't a DDoS attack or a code bug. A single AI company's web crawler was hammering their product API with 39,000 requests per minute, each triggering complex database queries. According to recent analysis from Fastly , which monitors 6.5 trillion web requests monthly, this is becoming routine.

Neural retrieval and vector embeddings finally looked practical. After the release of ChatGPT, an assumption among some AI teams was that these powerful new models would solve the long-standing &#8220;enterprise search&#8221; problem. AI teams dove into fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agentic frameworks, expecting to conquer the corporate knowledge base. But despite the incredible advances in foundation models, enterprise search remains stubbornly difficult. It's a baffling disconnect: the same model that can eloquently explain quantum mechanics is often unable to give a straight answer to a seemingly simple question like, "What are our current quarterly goals?" After interviewing some founders and engineers working on this problem, I've discovered why. The real obstacles aren't what you'd expect. 1. The Foundational Rot: It's a Data Quality Problem, Not a Model Problem The core issue in enterprise search is the nature of the data itself. Unlike the public web, where pages have clear owners and URLs serve as stable identifiers, enterprise information lacks clear ownership, governance, and structure . For example, a system might contain three different versions of a "Q3 Sales Strategy" document &#8212; a draft in a shared drive, an outdated wiki page, and a final PDF in an email. This inherent ambiguity is compounded by "shadow documents" created by employees when they can't find the original, further polluting the knowledge base. Staleness and duplication create a low-signal environment where even strong retrievers struggle to find ground truth. This isn&#8217;t a failing of an algorithm; it&#8217;s a reflection of the input.

For all their success in the structured environment of a factory, these robots have struggled to break out of their cages and into more dynamic, general-purpose roles. This situation is not without precedent; for those of us who use AI, it mirrors the exact challenge we had with natural language processing until very recently &#8212; our models excelled within their narrow domains but couldn't transfer their capabilities beyond the specific use cases they were built for. For anyone involved in building AI applications today, the term "foundation model" &#8212; or "frontier model" &#8212; should be a familiar one. We've seen foundation models revolutionize knowledge work through language processing and redefine creativity with visual generation. But a more interesting question is now on the table: what happens when a model needs to do more than process digital bits? What if it needs to physically act in the world? This question brings us to a long-standing frustration in robotics. Historically, every new application has been a bespoke, ground-up effort. If you wanted a robot to fold laundry, you had to build a custom system for that specific task. If you then decided you wanted it to make coffee, you were essentially starting from scratch. This approach is akin to designing a new car for every single trip &#8212; it is slow, costly, and does not scale.

Agent Protocols grew up in 2025, there&#8217;s a new era coming. If 2025 was the first year of AI agents , how to build them? What should you know before you start? I asked for an in-depth guide on Agent protocols . To check out our other recent guides go here .

By Hodman Murad Read her introduction to the brand new company she&#8217;s build, Asaura AI (Beta launch April, 2026). Background and Startup Story Hodman Murad is the founder of Asaura AI , where she pioneers AI designed for executive function. As the author of The Data Letter , she identifies common failures in AI and data systems, such as hallucinated growth metrics and the costly loss of customers due to optimization. Beyond her technical expertise, she writes Asaura , a publication dedicated to exploring ways AI can be improved to enhance human productivity and mental health. She&#8217;s going to be building in public so you can follow along . Her work focuses on connecting high-performance systems with their users. This article is essentially a mini-book , 8,000 words and 61k characters. As a data scientist and consultant with so much B2B experience, I think she&#8217;s a great person to outline some of how AI agents work and for you to learn a bit more about the new protocols.

## Post 407: The 5 Claude Skills Every Digital Product Creator Needs 

**Publication:** AI Supremacy 
**Author:** Michael Spencer

This is part of our series on Claude Code, Claude Skills and related topics. Good Morning, This article is a bonus guide for premium readers. Why am I so Bullish on Claude Code? It&#8217;s my opinion that Claude Code was the single most impactful AI tool developed in 2025 that will be significantly upgraded and refined in 2026. If I post a lot of articles around Claude Code in the weeks ahead, this is why. In 2025 and moving into 2026, Claude Code signifies a shift from "assistive" AI (think: simple autocomplete) to "agentic" AI. While agentic AI may take some months and years to improve, there&#8217;s a lot of enthusiasm over the progress made already in 2025 with protocols like MCP and A2A and more to come. While Anthropic focuses on Enterprise AI customers, for founders and entrepreneurs, and even Creators, this can translate fairly well. Beyond Context Engineering: Agentic Orchestration Claude Code fluency will equal the professional fundamental skills of agentic AI orchestration. In short, if you spent time on AI tools like NotebookLM or ChatGPT in 2024 and 2025, Claude Code could be a worthwhile focus in 2026. I have a number of guides in the queue related to this topic. I think the bottom line is, context engineering in 2026 will begin to require more Claude Code fluency. Anthropic's Emergence in AI coding Claude Code is no longer just a chatbot that writes snippets; it is treated as a &#8220;junior developer&#8221; that can: Navigate Entire Codebases: It maintains awareness of project structures and can find information across hundreds of files. Execute Multi-step Tasks: It can plan a feature, modify multiple files, run tests, debug the failures, and create a git commit&#8212;all from a single natural language prompt. Subagents &amp; Parallelism: Version 2.0 introduced the ability to spawn &#8220;subagents.&#8221; These specialized threads work in parallel (e.g., one agent writes an API endpoint while another simultaneously writes its unit tests), significan...

Illustration: Vincent Kilbride , for Bloomberg. That&#8217;s quite an AI Bubble you have there ChatGPT. The future interface is likely NOT a chabot. This Newsletter is about AI Supremacy . Between the U.S. and China, but also among the biggest AI Startups. OpenAI in 2026 is likely to be pressured by both incumbents and AI startups, by Giants and more nimble specialist companies. . . We&#8217;ve never seen anything like it: OpenAI can go bust and it won&#8217;t even matter&#8230; I can&#8217;t stop thinking about OpenAI&#8217;s path ahead and how it might bifurcate from the real winners of AI in the year ahead of 2026. Some field notes follow. No napkin math but some opinions that might be relevant. People don&#8217;t fully realize what an IPO frenzy 2026 is going to bring and how much capex, debt fueled AI infrastructure build-outs and private AI startups valuations will keep rising next year. Circular financing of the 2025 variety is only going to increase, because Silicon Valley is betting on Generative AI to increase profits and earnings. With so much liquidity on the sidelines (due to years of QE and pandemic mismanagement by the Fed), the AI boom has yet to fully manifest (on the stock market) as the bull market prepares for AI frontier model, Chip and Neo Cloud companies to go IPOs in 2026. IPOs, M&amp;A and more AI startups with unrealistic valuations will mean a capital allocation binge like we&#8217;ve never seen before in the history of technology. There is little signs of the AI boom slowing down - Hyperscale datacenter operators nearly tripled their spending on infrastructure over the past three years in response to the AI craze, while the amount of operational capacity added each quarter has increased by 170 percent. OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the ChatGPT maker at up to $830 billion , The Wall Street Journal reported last Thursday , however something doesn&#8217;t quite feel right. xAI, Thinking Ma...

Good Morning, When all is and done, 2025 saw a significant increase in major AI datacenter projects , clusters and infrastructure. It&#8217;s easily one of the biggest trends in AI of 2025. This year we have seen a tidal wave of AI Infrastructure. But what will be the price for society? In 2025, the aggregate capital expenditure (CapEx) for top Big Tech hyperscalers is estimated to be over $400 billion , primarily driven by investments in AI infrastructure and data centers by BigTech and Cloud hyperscalers. Products like ChatGPT being adopted at scale will likely lead to a lower value of a College education, less human connection and less time spent reading. Is that good for society? &#129300; Is that the sort of world we think is healthy for consumers and our younger people? I&#8217;m not sure the benefits of chatbots even outweigh the costs. Leave a comment ChatGPT leading to less Reading Time YouTube, TikTok and especially ChatGPT are impacting reading time among our youngest teenage citizens.

This is our third article in our learning series on Genspark. See the first here , and the second here . I think my readers know how bullish I am on the skills of - who I asked to take another look at this AI startup (I keep bugging him about). There&#8217;s a good reason for this. Editor&#8217;s Introduction to Genspark In my mind Genspark used to be a Chinese Perplexity of sorts, with many ex members of Baidu. I incredibly liked the product when it focused on search . But it has morphed commercially into a rather impressive Agentic AI first startup. Honestly I can&#8217;t believe that they only recently just did their Series B funding . You might recall seeing Genspark if you ever came across &#8217;s Lean AI Leaderboard &#127942; View Leaderboard Genspark at of the time of writing ranks 16th globally in the most lucrative lean AI startups in the world. (This is not a sponsored post). As someone that studies AI startups and AI tools, Genspark is a case study that continues to fascinate me. It&#8217;s a fair example of how scrappy Chinese AI engineers can be (wherever they choose to be based). The pivots in product and pricing are textbook lean growth. Try Genspark Eric Jing, Kay Zhu, and Wen Sang founded Genspark, an AI company specializing in agentic AI for knowledge workers. Eric Jing serves as CEO, Kay Zhu as CTO, and Wen Sang as COO. The company was established in 2023 by Jing and Zhu, former Baidu executives, and later expanded to include Sang as a co-founder. Genspark has since achieved unicorn status with a valuation exceeding $1 billion following a $275 million Series B funding round in November 2025. Henry Shi&#8217;s list is ranked by revenue per employee. Genspark are doing fairly well in ARR compared to the low number of employees - the very definition of lean AI in the AI boom of 2023 to 2030.

Good Morning, Is it the end of an era for OpenAI as we approach 2026? I really want to get the pulse of OpenAI, because ChatGPT used to be symbolic of the potential of Generative AI. This week as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard - as first reported by the Wall Street Journal , Sam Altman sent an internal memo on Monday declaring a company-wide emergency. &#8220;OpenAI&#8217;s code red &#8221; is an internal directive. It was issued by CEO Sam Altman. The directive prioritizes improvements to ChatGPT. It also combats rising competition, mainly from Google&#8217;s Gemini models. The directive signals an urgent effort within the company to maintain its market lead. Let&#8217;s frame this. On November 30, 2022, OpenAI introduced a new product to the world, ChatGPT. In late 2022 and early 2023 we all marveled at its capabilities . It was a brave new world and OpenAI felt like the promising pioneer. Fast forward three years and there are chatbots like Gemini, Grok , Claude, Qwen , Perplexity, Genspark , DeepSeek, and at least a half dozen others worth using for specific kinds of tasks. Signs of a slow down in AI adoption, like the tightening labor market or lower consumer sentiment in the U.S. economy, are very real for millions of Americans and users all over the world. AI Bubble debates raging around ROI and AI Infrastructure debt or the capex around AI appear to have coincided with less adoption or a material slowing in adoption of AI products like ChatGPT. Recently according to Ramp AI Index , paid AI growth actually declined in September, 2025 by almost a full percent at 0.7%. &#8220;There are now more businesses than I ever remember before that struggle to explain how their unit economics are ever going to make sense. It usually requires an explanation on the order of infinite retention, a massive reduction in costs, a claim that eventually the company can stop buying users, or something even less plausible&#8230;&#8221; - Sam Altman 1 OpenAI&#8217;s Pivot into a P...

Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images In 2011 (a leading investor in Substack) wrote the iconic piece Software is Eating the World . In 2023, Marc Andreessen tried to make the case again with AI, this time with a twist . Between the generation of LLMs from an academic paper in 2017 to 2025, AI isn&#8217;t yet eating the world, and certainly is not saving it! As we head into 2026, the ludicrous notions of former Open-AI researchers , the AI 2027 crowd are beginning to subside along with the throngs of profiteers of Techno Optimists for a more realistic scenario. Is AI eating the world? On most days I wonder about if Nvidia, Google or datacenters might actually be the real culprit? TSMC is sort of incredible here and the foundational companies like ASML. Meanwhile AI will get political in 2026. As Mamdani (who is 34) met Trump (who is 79) one couldn&#8217;t help but feel that the affordability crisis , a future debt crisis and the AI Infrastructure build-out that the United States appears committed to are going to converge at some terrifying future date with potentially grave consequences. So could AI eat the world in the 2030s ? Probably in ways many people don&#8217;t yet anticipate. How about next year? I have some data and speculations to run by you. It&#8217;s not some vague notion of superintelligence that awaits us, but something very different.

## Post 422: Your guide to building apps with Google Antigravity

Google Good Morning, With Google&#8217;s Gemini 3 release they have improved their AI coding capabilities and agentic possibilities for developers and for Enterprise on the Cloud . Google Antigravity is an &#8216;agent-first&#8217; coding tool and it&#8217;s clear Google is going all-in on Agentic AI . But what are we talking about here exactly, what does it do and what is the full scope? Gemini 3 is bringing developers a taste of the agentic future. As Google Cloud&#8217;s growth explodes so too is its approach to vibe coding for non-technical builders as well. The Gemini 3 launch has gotten its fair share of critical acclaim not just for its benchmarks and performance but for its multimodal architecture and vision for what the future of AI is going to be like. I asked for a guide to this elusive Antigravity agentic IDE product. The AI Augmented Engineer The AI-Augmented Engineer Learn how to use AI tools to write better code, ship faster, and stay ahead of the curve By Jeff Morhous What does a next-generation IDE look like? How to use it and what can it do? Dive into Antigravity &#129522; Gemini 3 is SOTA on SWE Bench Verified with a standard agent harness (all models using the same independently created harness). Logan Kilpatrick, X. Building the Foundations for the Agentic Future What&#8217;s obvious about Gemini 3 is that it has been carefully optimized also for vibe coding and as an agentic coding model. Google says that Antigravity, which supports multiple agents and gives them direct access to the editor, terminal, and browser, is designed for an &#8220;agent-first future.&#8221; It&#8217;s clear Google is going after Cursor, Github Copilot and Claude Code with Antigravity. It does bring a few new features along with it. Antigravity will be available for free in public preview for Mac, Windows and Linux as of November 18th, 2025, with what Google calls &#8220;generous rate limits&#8221; for Gemini 3 Pro usage.

AWS us-east-1 went down hard this week and took half the internet with it. This happens every 12-18 months or so. Amazing it doesn&#8217;t happen more frequently, tbh. As always you have the Monday morning sysadmins chiming in with: This is why you use a different cloud This is why you multicloud This is why you don&#8217;t cloud at all All boiling down to: this is why you should build a stupendous edifice of technological wizardry that is IMMUNE TO AWS US-EAST-1 GOING DOWN. You mortal fools! We are paying the price for our hubris of science . Don&#8217;t you see? It doesn&#8217;t matter what your app architecture is. If AWS falls over, you are going to be affected NO MATTER WHAT. It&#8217;s not that AWS is too big to fail. AWS has become too big for you to avoid failing . I don&#8217;t care what the uptime of your haunted palace of Kubernetes is. If AWS is down, your vendors might be down. At least some of your integrations will surely be down. A whole bunch of your customers&#8212;you know, the people who have to be online in order to use your product&#8212;are guaranteed to be down. The CEO of Vercel found out about this outage because his bed died . At some point, if you want to do business, your app has to come in contact with the real world, and the real world runs on AWS. &#8220;But we vet our vendors / we are EU-regulated / blah blah &#8230;.&#8221; Please. The dependencies of these systems are way beyond your ability to be confident that AWS isn&#8217;t involved somewhere up the chain. Evelyn Osman is a platform engineer in Germany. She says &#8220;We use preset.io in their Stockholm location and they were impacted because they use Docker Hub so one of the components couldn&#8217;t scale out during the outage. We&#8217;re EU regulated and yet integrations had issues.&#8221; Let the reader understand: AWS falling over is the internet apocalypse. You people imagining hermetically-sealed no-AWS environments are doomsday preppers. Your doomsday island only prot...

## Post 425: Harsh truths to save you from ChatGPT psychosis

**Publication:** Good Tech Things

**Published:** 2025-08-14T20:44:45+00:00

**Content Preview:**
I am currently dealing with multiple people in my life who seem deep in the throes of what Futurism calls &#8220; ChatGPT psychosis .&#8221; I suspect you may know people like this as well. It is alarming and perplexing. People have been confusing chatbots for sentient conversation partners since the 1960s , but what&#8217;s going on here feels new. Sometimes the victims of ChatGPT (or Claude, or Gemini) psychosis come to believe that AI is a godlike entity &#8212;but it never starts there. First AI makes them feel that they themselves are superintelligent. That their most sophomoric ideas are brilliant, that their vague prompts qualify as original thinking, or that their uninformed speculations are important contributions to scholarly fields they have never studied. Once you come to believe that you are sort of a minor cybernetic deity, you have lost touch with reality in a subtle, terrifying way. You are at the mercy of whatever weird fantasy the LLM spits out next. The major LLMs are all in a sycophantic phase right now, which doesn&#8217;t help, but I doubt that &#8220; make the chatbots less encouraging &#8221; is an easy fix here. We are dealing with a technology uniquely suited to snipe intelligent, well-educated people into believing they are much, much smarter than they really are. That is an addictive sensation, not easily quit. That means you, yes you, reading this, are at risk. If you talk to LLMs at all&#8212;and at this point, who doesn&#8217;t?&#8212;it might not be a bad idea to post these reminders next to your computer, just to protect your own mind against infohazards: AI will not make you smarter. It will make you faster at retrieving (possibly correct) answers to certain questions. It will not improve your reasoning, judgment, or mental processing ability. It may even degrade them. Engaging in long, Socratic discussions with AI chatbots will not sharpen your rhetoric, it will only leave you screaming into your own personal void. AI will not lift...

Yesterday, this announcement went up on a website called Publisher&#8217;s Marketplace, used by agents and editors in the book industry: In case the weird run-on sentence format doesn&#8217;t make it clear: I have sold my first novel!! This is something I have wanted to do since I was a kid. It is a big deal for me and I am very, very pumped. Let&#8217;s break down that blob of text: THE BLEB PROJECT by Forrest Brazeal The novel is by me and THE BLEB PROJECT is what it&#8217;s called. Imprint: Ballantine Ballantine Books is an imprint of Penguin Random House, the biggest of the &#8220;Big Five&#8221; book publishers. I have read and enjoyed many books from Ballantine over the years, and I bet you have too. Here is one set of Ballantine editions that played a formative role in my life: You&#8217;ve either never seen these covers, or you&#8217;ll never forget them. A lot of 80s sci-fi cover art was like that. Publishing a book with Ballantine/PRH is a very big deal to me. So what is this book about, anyway? a novel that asks what happens when Silicon Valley invents time travel Silicon Valley invents the time machine. That is the elevator pitch. I started writing this in late 2023, while I was still at Google. I&#8217;d known for awhile I wanted to do a book about a tech bubble from beginning to end - I&#8217;d seen AI and crypto firsthand, and the shadow of the dot-com boom and bust still looms over the industry. Enough to see that there&#8217;s kind of an archetypal shape to these things, an almost mythic rise and fall of greed, hubris, and straight-up idiocy alongside all the technological gimcrackery. mixing satire and science fiction The tech industry is joyfully ludicrous and I wanted to do a satire, but I didn&#8217;t want to do HBO&#8217;s Silicon Valley. That story has been told, and updating it for the political climate of the 2020s didn&#8217;t seem worth the effort. So I thought maybe I should mix in a science-fiction element.

Dear Stupid 22-Year-Old Self, Congratulations on your shiny new computer science degree! You won&#8217;t be needing that anymore, feel free to forget all about it. You like writing code, which is convenient, because all you&#8217;ve heard from your parents and teachers is that Working With Computers (tm) puts you on a steady career path that will just trend upwards over time. They&#8217;re wrong. You think that $500,000+ comp packages for &#8220;senior software engineers&#8221; are a law of the universe, that they&#8217;re waiting at the end of the rainbow for anybody who can crank enough leetcode to pass a technical screen. You&#8217;re wrong about that, too, although it&#8217;ll be a few years before the tech bubble boils down enough for you to see why. You think that you&#8217;ll never have to become a manager, because &#8220;IC&#8221; (individual contributor) tracks at the FAANG companies go all the way up to Distinguished Engineer. That&#8217;s a VP-level position! You can get paid like an executive without ever having to do anything but write code. Except, you can&#8217;t. As in: you, specifically, probably can&#8217;t. Your parents and teachers did a good job convincing you that it was foolish to bet on becoming a concert pianist or a major league baseball player. You have to be a genetic freak to get one of those jobs, and probably rich and well-connected too. What they didn&#8217;t mention is that becoming a Distinguished Engineer at Amazon or Google is an order of magnitude harder than reaching the top as a professional musician or athlete. I&#8217;m not exaggerating. The NBA has the smallest roster sizes in North American professional sports; there are something like 500 active NBA players across all 32 teams. Last I checked, here in the far-off future year of 2025, there are about 50 Distinguished Engineers at Google. Your teachers tell you that you&#8217;re smart and ambitious. So be smart about this. Pulling down a 7-figure salary as a programmer is no...

I have spent the last 5 years telling myself &#8220;Someday I&#8217;m going to sit down and figure out what Nix actually is.&#8221; So I finally used the US holiday weekend to look into it. Here is what I learned: Nix is a set of tools for helping you configure your software environment exactly the same way every time. That is what it is. However&#8230; The ideas behind Nix are advanced, so much so that it started life as a guy named Eelco Dolstra&#8217;s Ph.D. dissertation 1 . It has a learning curve that goes beyond &#8220;steep&#8221; and does a full loop-the-loop, like one of those fairground rides that unfolds off the back of a truck. The biggest reason Nix is still a niche technology, rather than the One True Way that we manage our software packages, is that most professional software engineers who take one look at Nix say &#8220;Dear God, no. And also, what is it? Please make it stop.&#8221; For them, the cure (reshaping their brains to speak Nix) is worse than the disease. But those who persevere&#8212;interesting software shops like Replit and Shopify &#8212;choose Nix for a good reason. Because there is a disease. And it lies in wait for us all. THE DISEASE The disease is software itself. Specifically, software dependencies. All the little packages that your code imports, plus all the little packages that THEY import, right down to things like the C compiler included with your operating system (OS)&#8230; The metadata used to compile your system libraries&#8230; The minor version of your operating system&#8230; All those things your code needs to run are dependencies and collectively they are known as your software environment. (Sometimes Nix people prefer to say &#8220;the closure of your dependencies&#8221; which is a FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING way of saying &#8220;the whole universe of everything that you depend on&#8221; but FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING is one of those things a lot of us don&#8217;t feel comfortable thinking about and so we are not going to thin...

## Post 429: Why are tech people suddenly so into homeschooling?

It&#8217;s pretty disorienting to me that smart people, secular people, particularly people in tech, view homeschooling as a high-status option now. I was homeschooled for 13 years, from kindergarten all the way through 12th grade&#8212;you can tell that about me because I have essentially the same skill stack as Rapunzel from Tangled &#8212;and let me tell you, at no time were my six siblings and I considered the cool kids on the block. &#8220; Homeschooled&#8221;, according to Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls , historically meant one of two things, and I was both of them: An academic freak who wins spelling bees. 1 I was a two-time National Spelling Bee finalist in 2005-06. ESPN&#8217;s John Marvel once said he liked my odds for two reasons: 1) I was homeschooled and 2) I had a name he couldn&#8217;t pronounce. A religious freak who believes in young-earth creationism. The earth is thankfully old enough to have forgotten the full-length country-western musical I wrote in high school called &#8220;Creation vs Evolution: The West of the Story&#8221;. Pictured: Natalie Portman and me, both having a good day Mean Girls goes on to make sure we understand that Cady Heron (Lohan&#8217;s character) defies homeschooler stereotypes: she&#8217;s a well-traveled, broadly well-adjusted child homeschooled mainly out of necessity (her parents are roving scientists or something) rather than ideology. She&#8217;s an acceptable homeschooler - a unicorn! I don&#8217;t think a movie with this setup would make any sense today. Homeschooling is high-status now. My children&#8217;s generation is full of Cady Herons. But why? The tactical arguments for and against homeschooling all cancel each other out. Pro-homeschooling: At school, you&#8217;re in danger of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Anti-homeschooling: Statistically, you&#8217;re in greater danger of all those things at home. And the risk gets bigger if you eliminate outside influences that might notice when something&#8217;s w...

You know what struck me as the strangest thing about the 2024 edition of AWS re:Invent? It wasn&#8217;t the giant video boards on the Las Vegas Strip that interspersed ads for topless revues with ads for PagerDuty and Cribl, although that was unintentionally very funny. It was the fact that, as far as I can tell, AWS didn&#8217;t launch a single new top-level service. I could be missing something here, but check out the top announcements for yourself. The new service I think people are most excited about, DSQL, launched under the Aurora branding. Amazon Nova is a class of foundation models on Bedrock. Other than that: it&#8217;s a lot of new AI capabilities for Q and Sagemaker, some fun new database-y enhancements for S3, etc. I don&#8217;t have to learn a single new top-level service name in order to understand why I should care about what happened at re:Invent this year. This, to put it mildly, has not always been the case. Let me show you something. 2014 was the first year I really paid attention to re:Invent. That was the year my CEO at the time, Charles Phillips of Infor, claimed onstage at an AWS event that &#8220; friends don&#8217;t let friends build data centers .&#8221; It was also the year in which these were the big keynote announcements : Aurora. Technically released under the RDS brand. Still a stone-cold, first-ballot-hall-of-fame AWS service. KMS. Essential, bread-and butter AWS service. Config and Service Catalog. Good-enough admin services, they continue to be used and abused today. CodeDeploy/CodePipeline/CodeCommit. People have given them lots of chances over the years. CodeCommit has sadly been deprecated, the other two live on. Everybody has used them at one point or another, even if they will never be best-in-class devtools. (Foreshadowing!) ECS. Easy hall-of-famer, even if EKS has more momentum these days. Lambda. Inner-circle hall-of-famer, perhaps the most innovative cloud service of all time.

## Post 431: The case against living in the Bay Area, for ambitious tech people

Here is a tweet that made lots of people mad: First off: it&#8217;s engagement bait and probably not worth writing a whole post about. But dammit, I got baited and here I am. Second off: I do not live in the Bay Area. I never have. I&#8217;ve had a reasonably successful career, and now co-run a fast-growing tech company . But by the standards of this tweet, I and many well-known tech people around the world lack either judgment or ambition. Maybe both! What makes Flo&#8217;s tweet such perfect engagement bait is that there&#8217;s no sufficiently ambitious accomplishment that would disprove it. Why? Because it&#8217;s tautological. Bay Area people, in the frame of this tweet, are by definition the most ambitious people in tech. Thus, ambitious behaviors are behaviors that take place in the Bay Area. Round and round we go. It&#8217;s circular thinking, but as G.K. Chesterton liked to point out, all circles are perfect. They just may not be big enough to hold all of reality. Look, if you want to play the Tech Industry (tm) game the way Bay Area people are playing it, you should absolutely be in the Bay Area. You will be surrounded by people who are living and breathing AI and devtools and infra and open-source. You will rub up against funders and founders and grifters and strivers of all stripes. It&#8217;s a tight-knit industry and the groupthink can be suffocating. Here are some things it is very hard to avoid believing if you hang around ambitious people in the Bay Area: Taking as much money from venture capitalists as you can, as soon as possible, is a mark of success and a status symbol unto itself. Every problem has a technical solution if you&#8217;re smart enough. &#8220;Technical people&#8221; (software developers) are the noblest and most useful people at a tech company. SaaS (software-as-a-service) is the world&#8217;s most prestigious business model. Graduates from a few top schools (Stanford, MIT, etc) and people under thirty make the best employees. Nami...

## Post 432: Tech the Heck? Archera

**Content Preview:**
As you may recall from the first edition : Tech the Heck? is a recurring feature in which I try to explain in plain language what a particular tech startup&#8217;s product does - despite it being non-obvious on their own product page . Today&#8217;s sponsor / victim stepping into the arena is Archera , a Freeman &amp; Forrest client. Kudos to them for being good sports about this - I only do these write-ups with permission, but Archera has no editorial control over what I say. As far as I can tell, there are two types of cloud cost management products. The first kind, like CloudHealth and its many &#8220;FinOps&#8221; alternatives, primarily focuses on planning and reporting. Their value prop is that they give you better tools to figure out where your IT budget is going, and how to allocate it, than the AWS Billing console does. The other kind promises to sell you cloud at a discount, and those products tend to have a red flashing warning label on them that goes SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM. Either they&#8217;re playing weird arbitrage games with resource reservations , or they&#8217;re asking you to give them way too much control over your billing accounts, or they&#8217;re charging you a massive 15-40% fee for &#8220;savings&#8221; you could probably get on your own with a few hours of effort. There&#8217;s a reason AWS is cracking down on some of these shady practices. Products that promise to charge a percentage of what they &#8220;save&#8221; you by booking EC2 instances on your behalf have a fundamental incentive mismatch: the more cloud you buy, the more money they make. This is the opposite of what you want your cloud cost management partner to be rooting for. So when I landed on Archera&#8217;s homepage , my sketchiness antennae were way, way up. At first glance, Archera looks like it could be another &#8220;we book your AWS Savings Plans and charge you a fee for it&#8221; vendor. The buzzwords are all there on their homepage: flexibility!

**Content Preview:**
Last month, I performed a 30-minute show called &#8220;Knowledge Worker&#8221; for the incredible audience at Gene Kim&#8217;s ETLS in Las Vegas. The show included 7 songs about the past, present, and future of &#8220;knowledge work&#8221; - or, more specifically, how it&#8217;s affecting us, the humans between keyboard and chair . I poured everything I&#8217;ve been thinking and feeling about AI for the last 2+ years into this show, and I feel a great sense of peace at having said what I meant to say. Here, for your enjoyment, are the songs (with a bit of &#8220;liner note&#8221; commentary provided in between). 1. Hype Train They say that if you can get an audience to laugh with you, they&#8217;ll be willing to cry with you. &#8220;Hype Train&#8221; is an intentionally light, silly song to start the show. I used to try to get audiences to sing along with some of my songs. I have learned that tech people would die of starvation before they will open their mouths to sing in public. About the most I can get you all to do is clap along. 2. AGI (Artificial God Incarnate) I had a lot of fun writing the backing tracks for this song. The &#8220;Gregorian chant&#8221; backup singing was recorded at Heartwise Records in Seattle with the help of some incredible session musicians and producer Eric Munch. A number of people came up after the show to ask &#8220;What musical genre was that one, anyway?&#8221; I have no idea. If you figure it out, let me know. 3. What&#8217;s Left for Me? (The AI Existential Crisis Song) When ChatGPT first came out, I think a lot of us went through about 5 stages of grief: Shock (how is a language model this good? what the actual ***?) Denial (it&#8217;ll never be as good at writing code / words / etc as me. look at these hallucinations! silly model) Anger (how dare they train their models on my creative work?)

Quick thing up top: Fly.io is sponsoring the Cloud Resume Challenge in September! My buddy Jared calls them &#8220; the holy grail for hobby projects &#8221; for a reason: they&#8217;ve been on my radar for a few years as probably the fastest, most cost-effective AWS Lambda alternative for small teams and side projects. They&#8217;ve asked me to pass along a special offer to CRC challengers: for a limited time, claim $50 in credits to build something on their platform right now ! Steve Yegge wrote a thought-provoking piece earlier this summer called The Death of the Junior Developer . I&#8217;m still turning it over in my head because I heard Steve give a talk based on the article at last week&#8217;s ETLS conference . Let me tell you, the talk woke up everybody in the room. Steve, in person, is like an embodied version of his infamous Platforms Rant : he paces restlessly up and down the stage, spools out shocking opinions in a sort of breathless blurt, hurls insults at both the audience and himself, and generally comes across like a mad prophet from outer space. That does not, however, mean he&#8217;s wrong. Here&#8217;s the TL;DR of both talk and article: the current drying-up of the junior software engineer job market is not just a macroeconomic blip, it&#8217;s an inevitable result of AI doing all the low-level code-slinging tasks we used to give to interns and fresh computer science graduates. We still need developers, says Steve, but they&#8217;ve got to be experienced enough to keep the AI code-generators honest and on track. Juniors simply can&#8217;t keep up. When everyone&#8217;s senior, no one will be If you read to the end of Steve&#8217;s article, he suggests that many top CS graduates are effectively &#8220;already senior&#8221; by the time they graduate, because they&#8217;ve put in a ton of extra time on OSS projects, etc, to pick up relevant skills.

## Post 435: The end of the Everything Cloud

Longtime customers know there are two distinct categories of AWS services. Category 1 contains the gold-plated, inner-circle, first-ballot Hall-of-Fame services like EC2, S3, DynamoDB, etc. These are the moneymakers, the heavy hitters, the Babe Ruth and Willie Mays of the cloud. If one of them falls over, the entire internet has a bad day . Category 2 contains &#8230; everything else . Just as Amazon is the Everything Store, AWS is the Everything Cloud. Did you know AWS has a service for spatial simulations (SimSpace Weaver)? An analytics service for capital markets (FinSpace)? Can you articulate the difference between Forecast and Timestream, or between CodeStar and CodeCatalyst? For the past 10 years or so, AWS has been rolling out these peripheral services at an astonishing rate, dozens every year. A few get traction, most don&#8217;t&#8212;but they all stick around, undead zombies behind impressive-looking marketing pages, because historically AWS just doesn&#8217;t make many breaking changes. That&#8217;s been the unspoken commitment between AWS and its customers. If we roll it out, no matter how silly or misguided, we will keep it running forever. Until the end of the internet &#8230; or not There is, however, a new sheriff in town at AWS . His name is Matt Garman, he&#8217;s got sales experience as well as engineering on his resume, and he seems to have this weird idea that AWS&#8217;s products should make money. Sticking with the baseball Hall of Fame analogy: if S3 is Babe Ruth, these Category 2 services are more like Sunny Jim Bottomley . Yes, he technically has a plaque in the Hall of Fame, but nobody&#8217;s paying admission to see him. And, all of a sudden, some of those Sunny Jim-tier services are having their Hall of Fame plaques stripped. (In fairness, this started even before Garman took over.) The estimable Scott Piper maintains a list of the services to have been deprecated over the last few months. CodeStar has been memory-holed. Cloud9, AWS&#821...

I was stupid enough to make some predictions about the post-COVID world on March 13, 2020: Some of them have not aged well. The USA did not pass a public-health version of the Patriot Act with far-reaching surveillance powers. The world&#8217;s digital infrastructure held up just fine, despite most of our COBOL programmers falling in an elevated COVID risk demographic. Sadly, we did not come to a global long-term consensus that knowledge work is just as effectively done from home. But I did make one prediction that has held up: I called the end of &#8220;peak tech conference.&#8221; The end of frivolous conference travel At the time it was clear to me that a lot of tech events had become &#8220;DevRel talking to DevRel&#8221; ouroboroses that consumed wasteful amounts of time, travel, and swag for little real benefit to anyone. I suspected that marketing departments would wake up to the fact that there are better places to spend growth dollars. And I assumed that companies would become much more hesitant to send valuable engineers into crowded public places. All of that turned out to be true. The end of the zero-interest-rate environment, and the associated tightening of budgets across the industry, only exacerbated the trend. Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been asking a bunch of engineers and managers in tech about how their company policies on conference travel have changed. Here are some common themes I hear: &#8220;We are freezing hiring and raises across the org. I&#8217;d be crazy even to ask for budget to travel for a conference.&#8221; &#8220;We used to have a per-person training budget, but now we just have one lump sum for all team travel. So we have to choose between getting our whole team together offsite or sending a few individuals to a conference.&#8221; &#8220;Professional development opportunities used to be crucial for hiring and retention, but the job market is so bad that that&#8217;s not true anymore.&#8221; &#8220;If I&#8217;m going to pay ...

My old colleague and personal hero Jared Short received a sponsorship from Typesense to build something interesting with their search engine. The thing he built somewhat took me aback . I asked him to write up his development process, stream-of-consciousness style, so we can all benefit from it. This is what the software engineering world looks like now. For better or for worse, there is no going back. Jared&#8217;s words follow: A comical application of AI and really fast search I spent a couple days thinking about what to build, and after revisiting the Typesense feature list a few times, one idea stood out: semantic search using embeddings. Quick primer on embeddings (skip this if you already know) If you're not familiar with embeddings, they are a technique to represent data, especially complex or high-dimensional data, in a simpler, lower-dimensional form. In the context of text, this means words that have similar meanings are mapped closer together in the vector space. For example, words like "vehicle,", "airplane," and "helicopter" would be placed nearer each other in the vector space, while they would be further from less related words like "pencil" or "telephone." This makes it easier for a machine to understand and process the relationships between different words. Let&#8217;s assume a 2-dimensional vector space (X, Y). Words like &#8220;vehicle&#8221; may be assigned a value like (2, 3) and &#8220;airplane&#8221; (2.2, 3.2) while a much less related &#8220;pencil&#8221; would be (5, 1). Represented as a graph, vector search with those embeddings on the 2d space would look something like this. Fun fact: the graph above was generated completely within ChatGPT after asking it to come up with a few examples of words and their embedding values, and then graph it. You can see then how if you took similar words and a more dimensional space, most embedding models are hundreds or low single digit thousands right now. Searching for things like helicopters, we can u...

Happy summer! First up: In last week&#8217;s issue, I came after Google Cloud pretty hard for not posting a root-cause analysis of the mysterious outage that took down a large customer named UniSuper. Credit to them, just a few days later they released a statement containing everything I called for and more: They took full responsibility for the issue without making excuses (even though, given that VMware Engine was indeed involved, I guess they could have tried to blame Broadcom). They provided a clear technical explanation of why the outage happened. That tricky word &#8220;subscription&#8221; that confused so many of us in the initial reporting about the issue? It&#8217;s referring to their provisioned VMware tenant, which was accidentally set to expire after one year. They laid out in reasonable detail what steps they are taking to prevent this class of incident from occurring in future, and why it was a freak occurrence unlikely to happen again: this was a config mistake during a since-deprecated setup process involving a single resource, not reflective of an underlying issue with GCP&#8217;s technical stability. Customers and investors can breathe a huge sigh of relief. We can nitpick about how it would have been nice to have this statement within days rather than weeks, but I was hard on GCP last week so I want to be equally generous to them here. However long it took to put together, this is an outstanding statement. It&#8217;s clearly worded, technically informative without overly exposing the customer, and appropriately reassuring without being glib. I&#8217;m impressed by the work of the comms team, the marketing team, and of course the engineering and support teams who put it together. I hope this is a template for the kind of communication Google Cloud will have with its customers going forward. Oops, all cartoons I&#8217;ve gotten a little behind on sharing new cartoons with you - so here are several, as well as a small announcement you may find intere...

OK so the big news today is that I accidentally started a company . &#8220;Influencers-as-a-service&#8221; is the short version. My cofounder Emily and I have spent a lot of time on both sides of this market as underpaid tech creators and under-supported technical marketers. If you fall into either of those camps, you should definitely chat with us . On to today&#8217;s Good (and not-so-good) Tech Things&#8230; Today we&#8217;re looking at two concurrent issues that affected customers on AWS and Google Cloud. The way the providers responded reflects deep differences in their DNA .. and in their trustworthiness. A tale of two clouds AWS isn&#8217;t what they used to be. &#8220;It&#8217;s feeling a lot like Day Two over here,&#8221; friends at AWS often tell me, shaking their heads sadly. A sweaty pursuit of generative AI has clouded their historic focus on IaaS building blocks. A myopic insistence on RTO continues to force out top talent . They&#8217;re even deprecating services now. (My 168 AWS Services song from 2020 references at least 4 services, not counting SimpleDB, that have since been or soon will be entirely scrubbed from the docs and SDKs: Workdocs, Honeycode, Snowmobile, and Alexa for Business.) But you know what AWS still does better than anybody else? They actually listen to their customers and bend over backwards to help them out. Case in point: on April 29th, a software engineer named Maciej Pocwierz discovered an unusual behavior in Amazon S3 that left him on the hook for a $1,300 bill. Cliff&#8217;s Notes explanation of the behavior: S3 buckets all exist in a single global namespace. Anybody can try to access any S3 bucket, with or without an AWS account, if they happen to guess the bucket name. Assuming the bucket is not publicly accessible, the unauthorized user will get a generic HTTP 4xx error code. In this case, the unauthorized requests (over 100 million of them!) were coming from the makers of a widely-used open-source tool, who had accidenta...

I posted my very-first-ever StackOverflow question on the second day of my first job after college. I really wanted to link the post here, but it was so long ago that I can&#8217;t find the question, or even the throwaway account I was using at the time. I think it was something about talking to SQL Server with PowerShell. I do remember that I felt nervous, overwhelmed, out of my depth in my new job. I was too embarrassed to ask a coworker for help. Posting on Stack Overflow felt like a last-ditch effort, a Hail Mary pass. The next day I logged in and checked my post, hoping against hope that somebody had taken pity on my plight. The post had been closed as off-topic. I didn&#8217;t post again for years. Even a decade ago, Stack Overflow had already developed a reputation as kind of a prickly, intimidating place. Users weren&#8217;t shy to let you know if they thought you had posted something dumb. The top contributors (like the legendary Jon Skeet ) were so fast at gobbling up answers to the good questions that it was hard for new contributors to amass reputation points. The system of relying on user upvotes to rank multiple answers, rather than crowdsourcing a single canonical response to each question &#224; la Wikipedia, meant that out-of-date or just plain wrong answers often appeared at the top of the page. None of it mattered because Stack Overflow was a quantum leap in surfacing help for programmers. The upvoting system was janky, but it worked better than any previous tech forum. (Remember &#8220;Tom&#8217;s Hardware&#8221;? The 27th page of Google search results sure does.) The userbase was polyglot and omniplatform: you could find answers on just about any programming topic. And it was certainly faster than reading man pages. Or, crucially, it felt faster. Stack Overflow gave stumped programmers the dopamine hit of looking up the solution to their problems , rather than learning how to solve them. In this way, too, Stack Overflow was ahead of its time.

## Post 441: Why didn't one of the big clouds buy HashiCorp?

So, IBM bought HashiCorp . IBM has become such a shadowy afterthought 1 that I don&#8217;t think too many people have strong feelings about them anymore. The big question is whether they will ditch HashiCorp&#8217;s new BUSL licensing scheme and go back to a true open-source model for products like Terraform and Vault, and I think it speaks to people&#8217;s lack of a handle on what IBM is up to these days that a plausible sentiment is &#8220; hey, they might do it !&#8221; The main reaction from the community about HashiCorp spinning an increasingly narrow set of options into a $6.4 billion exit is &#8220; Welp &#8230; good for them .&#8221; And when a community says good for them, it&#8217;s quite conspicuous what they&#8217;re not saying: good for us. But I want to raise a different question today: how the heck did we get to this point? Why was HashiCorp not snapped up long ago by a more viable cloud provider? Specifically: why did they not get bought by Google Cloud? On the surface it seems like a match made in heaven, doesn&#8217;t it? Google Cloud is the number three cloud provider; a huge slice of their competitors&#8217; customers use and love HashiCorp products every day. Seems like a chance to steal some new fans. Google has historically cultivated a generous attitude toward open source. Hear those drums in the distance? That&#8217;s the cursed board game of Kubernetes floating down the river towards you right now. I bet they wouldn&#8217;t think twice about donating Terraform to the Linux Foundation , bringing the renegades at OpenTofu back into the fold. Google Cloud has a long history of making large strategic ops acquisitions (Stackdriver, Mandiant, Chronicle). Adding Vault and friends to their product portfolio would not be out of character for them. Google Cloud already treats Terraform pretty much as their default deployment option! (Technically they have a bespoke service called &#8220;Google Cloud Deployment Manager&#8221;, but it is deprecated in...

Here is a fact that has caused me some sleepless nights: Less than 1% of people who start the Cloud Resume Challenge finish it. I say &#8220;less than 1%&#8221; because about 1-2% of the people who bother to tell me they are working on it eventually show up with a semi-finished project. The overall completion rate is probably lower. That 1-2% of people, to be clear, are AWESOME. They are self-starters, systems thinkers. They will all be VPs of something in 10 years. And they come from every conceivable background from all over the world - stay-at-home single moms, plumbers , poker players, retail workers and dentists and delivery drivers and loggers (the lumberjack kind) and architects (the skyscraper kind) and engineers (the mining kind) and teachers and help deskers and 17-year-old high school dropouts. Outside of existing IT experience, there is no obvious background that predicts who is going to do well on this project. And yet, overall, only about 1% of them do. For a long time I was convinced that this was an enablement failure on my part. And it may well be. So I tried a bunch of things to give people better tools for completing the Cloud Resume Challenge. I wrote a guidebook . I wrote three guidebooks . I started a Discord server (it&#8217;s past 10,000 members now!) And last year, I started doing free monthly sprints, each with a cohort between 100 and 200 people. The sprints included live office hours, weekly pace emails, community support, and as much additional help and guidance as I could figure out how to give without actually doing people&#8217;s work for them. And the challenge completion rate for sprinters went all the way up to &#8230;. 2.4 percent. The rest just dropped out and ghosted us. Again, those 2.4% of people are AWESOME. They are proactive communicators and they know how to learn. They will all be CTOs in 10 years. But &#8230; 2.4%?

A great civilization is not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within. -Will Durant The viability of open-source software was challenged twice over the past couple of weeks. One attack came from an outside adversary, the other from within the community itself. While the external threat triggered wider consternation, the internal threat seems to me far more dangerous. NB: while I have created and contributed to various open-source projects over the years, I am certainly not an expert on OSS governance. Today&#8217;s edition of Good Tech Things is not intended to be &#8220;thought leadership&#8221; or whatever, just a tool for me to organize my own thoughts. Outside threat: The XZ thing If nobody had ever heard of open-source, and you wrote an undergrad paper today proposing it as the way to develop the software that runs the world, you would get an F minus. Thesis sentence of your undergrad paper : Random people will anonymously create much of the world&#8217;s critically important software in their spare time, companies will make billions of dollars by using it for free, and this situation will remain shelf-stable for decades. Instructor&#8217;s comment in red pen : This makes no sense. What would motivate any self-respecting software developer to participate in a scheme like this? And how do you know the resultant code will be any good? Point 1 of your paper : Obsessive nerds will tear each other to pieces to make sure the code is as good as possible, because they just can&#8217;t help themselves. Instructor, in red pen : That doesn&#8217;t sound like a sustainable state of affairs. Point 2 of your paper : It works for Wikipedia. Instructor, in even redder pen : You are not allowed to cite Wikipedia in an academic context. F minus. Anyway, open-source&#8212;like Wikipedia and the BGP protocol&#8212;is one of those networked-collaboration things that makes no sense on paper, but in practice is more resilient than any centrally-managed system ...

## Post 444: You shouldn’t roll your own billing system, but we did it anyway. Why?

**Content Preview:**
Nowadays, it&#8217;s widely understood that building your own billing system is a bad idea &#8212; like rolling your own encryption, taking up smoking, or buying a timeshare. Ask Hacker News; or your favorite LLM; the resounding answer is simple: don&#8217;t do it! Thankfully, we live in a world where Hacker News and LLMs aren&#8217;t always right. At Mixpanel, we made the decision to invest in our own billing system, instead of purchasing one off the shelf. In this article, I&#8217;ll not only explain our decision, but also provide some questions that you (the reader) need to answer before making a decision (in either direction). Today, I&#8217;ll play &#8220;devil&#8217;s advocate&#8221;, and explore many of the problems that can arise when integrating an off-the-shelf billing system into your B2B SaaS business. My goal is not to spread FUD about a particular vendor, or to argue that it is never correct to purchase an off-the-shelf billing system. Rather, my goal is to ensure that my reader is asking the right questions, so that they come to the best possible decision. First, let&#8217;s steelman the &#8220;buy&#8221; perspective: The argument against building your own billing system generally goes like this: Billing has numerous complexities and edge cases . These may not seem like huge problems now, especially from an engineer&#8217;s perspective, but they will cause immeasurable pain and suffering in the future. Solutions to many of these problems can be purchased from vendors that specialize in solving them; open-source solutions are also available . Billing is rarely core to your product, and working on it requires resources that could be spent on your product instead&#8230; especially at a startup. Therefore, you should not build your own billing system, or build as little of it as possible; rather, you should leverage these out-of-the-box solutions as far as practicable. Where&#8217;s the lie? I agree with all three premises in this argument. For many compa...

**Content Preview:**
The 256 Character Problem That Almost Broke Our Heatmaps Imagine trying to locate specific DOM elements involved in millions of user interactions, spanning countless page states and screen sizes. You&#8217;d need element data, like tag names, IDs, class lists, and ancestor hierarchies, to reliably match to a clicked button across a mobile viewport and a 4K desktop display. But the API that needs to support querying this element data has a hard 256 character limit for property values, and your solution needs to scale to of millions of user interactions daily. This was just one of several interesting technical challenges we encountered while building heatmaps at Mixpanel. Building what appears to be a straightforward visualization feature turned into a deep dive through coordinate system transformations, API workarounds, and the fundamental question of how to visualize user behavior across wildly different screen sizes and page layouts. Pixels or DOM Elements, why not both? Heatmaps are visual representations of user interactions on web pages, and we built support for two distinct approaches. Traditional heatmaps use x and y coordinates to create color gradients showing interaction density, with warmer colors indicating more activity in a given area. Clickmaps, on the other hand, identify specific DOM elements that were clicked and display boxes around them, making it easy to see exactly which buttons, links, or other content areas received the most attention. From Individual Sessions to Aggregate Insights Mixpanel&#8217;s Heatmaps emerged from a clear customer need. While our Session Replay gives teams insight into individual user journeys, customers wanted to understand interaction patterns on their pages across many sessions. Marketing teams needed to see where users engaged most on landing pages. Product teams wanted to identify confusing UI elements and flows. For us, this wasn't just another feature. It was table stakes for competing in the modern analytics land...

Part of an Engineering Manager&#8217;s (EM) job description is helping their team grow their skills. Well at least it should be. To do this well, a Manager and Engineer should be on the same page for what they would like to improve on. As with many things in software engineering, you need alignment! Getting alignment on people's strengths and weaknesses can be hard. These conversations require a level of comfort, introspection, and communication that can take time to build. However, waiting too long to have this discussion is an anti-pattern. You want to be aligned on growth targets at the start of a performance review period, not at the end of it. Enter the The Engineering Skill Points Game, a tool I&#8217;ve been using here at Mixpanel to more quickly learn engineers' skills and desired growth. I&#8217;ve gotten positive feedback on the exercise, so decided to share it on our blog! The Idea Inspired by Role Playing Games (RPGs) such as Oblivion or Dungeons &amp; Dragons, The Engineering Skill Points Game involves the IC creating a &#8216;skill distribution&#8217; for themselves, representing both their skills today and their skills in an ideal future. This forces the IC and EM to have a conversation about what skills are important to the job, relative strengths and weaknesses, and future growth. Skill List from The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion On top of that I like to think it is fun! Let&#8217;s get down to how it works. The Engineering Skill Points Game Setup - breaking the ice and setting the stage What Are Engineering Skills? - Calibration on the different aspects of engineering What Are Your Skill Levels? - Calibration on strengths and weaknesses What&#8217;s Your Plan? - Calibration on goals Setup Before the exercise I ask a few setup questions to prime the conversation. First, &#8220;What role would you like to be doing in 5 years?&#8221; I give some preset options: architect, pure IC, manager, another role in tech, or already retired. This opens up the career c...

As AI continues to reshape software products, understanding how users interact with AI features has become more critical&#8212;and more complex&#8212;than ever. Traditional product analytics focused on button clicks and page views is no longer sufficient to capture modern usage patterns like free-form prompting or dynamic AI responses. The opaque nature of AI systems, particularly LLM-powered features, makes measuring user experience harder&#8212;but also more essential. Strong analytics isn't a luxury; it's foundational to iterating quickly and delivering value in AI-native products. At Mixpanel, we&#8217;ve been talking to leading AI product teams to understand how they measure success, and we&#8217;ve applied those learnings to our own AI product, Spark AI. This post shares the most valuable metrics we&#8217;ve found and how you can implement them using Mixpanel&#8212;plus, we&#8217;ve bundled it all into a dashboard template for AI teams to help you get started. What Events to Track for Your AI Product Before we can build a dashboard, you need the right event data. Below is a recommended baseline schema for AI products&#8212;particularly LLM-powered interfaces like chatbots, copilots, or agents. These events give you full visibility into how users interact with AI features, and how well those features are performing. Each event includes properties to capture deeper context&#8212;critical for debugging, performance tuning, cost analysis, and user behavior insights. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!=...

## Post 450: Turn data-driven decisions into informed decisions

**Publication:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**Author:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**URL:** https://metricstack.substack.com/p/turn-data-driven-decisions-into-informed
**Published:** 2024-08-22T17:50:07+00:00

The business world has been championing data-driven decision making for the last few decades. The concept is simple: Get data into the hands of business users so they can make the right decisions at the right time. Producers of data tools, such as data warehouses and business intelligence applications, have promoted the idea that, with the right data, every decision will be effective and lead to positive outcomes. Although there has been some progress in the adoption and successful use of data in decision making, the results are not up to the promise. In this article, we&#8217;ll look at what&#8217;s missing from the information pipeline and how it can be reworked to empower timely, informed decisions for business leaders everywhere. Data is not information When people say they want to make data-driven decisions , what they really mean is they want to make informed decisions - decisions that are based on information, not data. What&#8217;s the difference between information and data? Data becomes information when it&#8217;s processed, cleaned, aggregated, and given context. As information, data can be effortlessly understood by decision makers and applied to real-world problems. For example, a set of sales records for various stores in a data warehouse is data. In its raw form, it doesn&#8217;t offer much. However, when it&#8217;s aggregated and the expenses are subtracted for each store (in other words, when it becomes information), it can be used to determine relative store profitability. Sales transactions are data. Profit values per store are information. Businesses can make informed decisions about which stores to invest in based on the derived information. It doesn&#8217;t stop there. Over time, this kind of information becomes knowledge and wisdom. As business teams find patterns in the information they use, they develop a set of repeatable decisions to help them run their business. The business world is still focused on data Historically, analytics tools hav...

## Post 451: Get Metrics-Ready - with Your Existing Data Stack

**Publication:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**Author:** Metric Stack Newsletter

Learn how PowerMetrics enables data teams to create and fulfill metrics from diverse data sources, including data warehouses, semantic layers, service APIs and spreadsheets. Its flexible integrations approach gets data teams started with metrics, no matter what their current data stack looks like. PowerMetrics kickstarts a metrics-first strategy and is&nbsp;designed to evolve with your data stack as it matures. All the while, PowerMetrics will continue to ensure consistent, straightforward analytics across the entire organization. Join us for the webinar on June 18! At Klipfolio, we believe in a metrics-first analytics strategy. We built PowerMetrics , an approachable metric-based product, to help business users understand their data and make better decisions. The concept of &#8220;metrics as data artifacts&#8221; is powerful, yet simple: All metrics follow the same rules and expose the same capabilities, regardless of how they&#8217;re defined or fulfilled. This unique quality makes it easy to learn how to use and extract real-world value from the data in metrics. This universal approach to data consumption is one of the driving forces behind our metric philosophy . Compared to consuming metric data in visualizations, creating and fulfilling metrics is part of a diverse, and sometimes complex, environment. The reality for most data teams is that their data is everywhere, stored in many different kinds of storage systems, and exposed through many different types of APIs. There&#8217;s no &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; data stack, and, as such, the way in which metrics need to be defined differs considerably from organization to organization. Adding to this mix - data stacks evolve over time within the same organization as a business grows in its data needs and maturity. While the concept of metrics is gaining popularity, fulfillment has often been a challenge for data teams. At PowerMetrics, we took on that challenge - and we think we solved it.

## Post 452: Is Big Data going through an object-oriented revolution?

**Publication:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**Author:** Metric Stack Newsletter

**Content Preview:**
There&#8217;s no denying it &#8211; Data is complex! Despite advancements in data warehousing and business intelligence products, the ability to analyze, manipulate, and model data remains elusive for most users. The first step toward a solution is admitting that these struggles are fundamentally about complexity. The software industry addresses the issue of complexity every day. If you remove all of the details, like tooling and programming languages, software is mainly about abstracting complexity so that we humans can code complex logic into software applications. The more complexity programmers can handle, the more competitive they, and their organizations, can be when developing software. Taking on an increasing level of complexity and managing it effectively is a matter of survival for software developers. The same can be said for data teams and data consumers in data-driven organizations. There are many valuable lessons the data industry can learn from the software development process. There&#8217;s an object-oriented revolution in the works, with modern BI applications embracing metrics, a new kind of artifact. Just as objects manage complexity in software code bases, metrics act as building blocks in data management solutions, breaking down complexity in analytics and making it more accessible to everyone. Object-oriented methodology &#8211; A revolution in software development and data analytics In the software industry, complexity is often managed using object-oriented design. A far-reaching innovation, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a modern application that wasn&#8217;t written using this approach. In this methodology, programming logic is organized into well-defined parts, making it possible for developers to manage much more sophisticated code bases. This object-oriented approach has enabled the next level of software development, pushing the bounds of complexity that can be handled by a software team to new heights. It&#8217;s time for data-driv...

## Post 453: How metrics re-establish trust

**Publication:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**Author:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**URL:** https://metricstack.substack.com/p/how-metrics-re-establish-trust
**Published:** 2024-04-17T19:10:54+00:00

**Content Preview:**
A metric is a new type of BI artifact that captures the data and meaning around a single business concept. Unlike traditional BI models and reports, metrics don&#8217;t expose any end user configurations that could change the meaning of the metric. Once metrics are defined, you know they can be trusted. And, the ability to retrieve data using contextual queries makes for flexible, comprehensive analytics. With metrics, you get the best of business intelligence analysis &#8211; trustworthy, all-encompassing data for effective decision making. Why complex BI tools may not be as powerful as they seem Over the last few decades, BI products have focused more and more on flexibility and rich feature sets. More capability was assumed to mean more power and more value. Yet, studies show most companies that could take advantage of these advanced BI tools continue to use spreadsheets instead. As we all know, BI software has evolved tremendously, with capabilities that could make any business user seem like a data superhero. So, why aren't more business teams adopting these feature-rich BI tools into their daily decision making? It all boils down to trust, or, more specifically, the lack of it. Thanks for reading Metric Stack Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Business users often lack confidence in the data &#8211; Is it accurate? Is it the most recent? Is it the right version? Sometimes they&#8217;re not sure if they can trust the sources of the data or if the data team fully understood their request, saying the data doesn&#8217;t look like what they asked for. On top of this, most BI tools include features that require a deep understanding of the data to really see what&#8217;s going on. This stumbling block makes it difficult for the casual user to trust the tool or that they&#8217;re using it appropriately to solve their immediate issue. An unfair expectation has been placed on the average business user to become a data expert in orde...

Summary - In this article (the second in a two-part series ), we dive into the opportunities that metric-centric analytics tools provide to data teams, decision makers, and analysts. We also explore the future of analytics, where BI systems work equally well for machine and human consumption and where everyone understands and leverages the power of data. Recap from Part 1 : The evolution of Business Intelligence (BI) software design has been fuelled by the need to understand and effectively use data to make good decisions. A third generation of BI tools is emerging. It&#8217;s centered around metrics &#8211; BI artifacts that capture purpose and data and address the immediate needs of decision makers &#8211; in a way that reports don&#8217;t. Metric-centric analytics solutions, like Klipfolio PowerMetrics , treat metrics as first-class artifacts and are designed for independent analysis by business users. Thanks for reading Metric Stack Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Everyone benefits from metric-centric BI The first two generations of BI tools manipulated and presented information but didn&#8217;t focus on the real purpose of data &#8211; enabling and supporting good business decisions. Metric-centric BI builds purpose into the data so even less technical users can make better decisions. Let&#8217;s look at how this new generation of BI solves business challenges for data teams, decision makers, and analysts. Why metric-centric BI is good for data teams Business users faced many usability challenges when working with 2nd generation BI. As a result, data teams spent a lot of time authoring reports, often based on ad hoc requests. With metric-centric BI, instead of authoring reports, data teams choose the right data for each metric and have more time for other meaningful work.&nbsp; Each metric has a specific definition. It&#8217;s easier (and faster) for data teams to fulfill a well-defined need versus managing a multi-purpo...

Summary - Over the years there&#8217;s been substantial investment in BI solutions &#8211; so why are so many of us still using spreadsheets?! In this article, the first in a two-part series, we look at the evolution of BI software design and see how the most recent generation of analytics can help us escape spreadsheets and embrace modern data tools. The evolution of Business Intelligence (BI) software design has been fuelled by the need to understand and effectively use data to make good decisions. However, studies show that more than half of businesses still struggle to generate value from their data or move beyond spreadsheets.&nbsp; How can we unlock the potential of BI software for business and data teams? Until recently there have been two clear generations of BI software &#8211; enterprise BI and departmental/personal BI. Let&#8217;s look at how these fall short and why a new third generation design is the key to modern decision-making. Thank you for reading Metric Stack Newsletter. This post is public so feel free to share it. Share First generation: Enterprise BI In the 1960s, mainframe computers, with their ability to store and process large amounts of data, became commercially available. It was a first step toward data-driven decision making, however, the exorbitant cost and the need for highly-trained technicians prevented widespread deployment. In the late 1970s, personal computing and tools such as spreadsheets came on the scene, enabling less technical business users to work with data. But, again, there were limitations. Multiple data storage solutions made it hard to know which data to analyze and how to tie everything together to effectively draw conclusions. Also, self-serve analytics tools specifically designed for business users were virtually non-existent. Complex solutions for experts Enterprise BI was designed to meet the needs of large organizations. Data experts modelled data into a form that enabled integration with other tools for interac...

Podcast Special The ultimate goal of data analytics is to drive sound and data-backed decisions across the organization. For most, however, this goal is still a North Star objective. Traditionally, companies have hired data teams and analysts to help business users work with analytics software and make data-driven decisions. Unfortunately, this approach doesn&#8217;t scale as the company grows. Thankfully, there&#8217;s a new generation of BI tools out there that are helping transform the role of data teams from internal service providers to platform builders. Adopting a semantic or metric layer enables data teams to focus on what they do best &#8211; building and maintaining infrastructure and doing deep data analysis. Business users work with centralized metrics and truly easy-to-use self-serve analytics tools, alleviating the need for data teams to &#8220;service&#8221; them with dashboards and reports. In this interview, Allan Wille, CEO at Klipfolio , sat down with Johan Baltzar, co-founder and CEO of Steep . Klipfolio and Steep share the same vision.

Summary: Navigating the Marketing Technology landscape has exploded to include over 11,000 companies, inundating marketers and data teams with disparate data sets. A metrics layer as part of the data stack is proposed to align marketing and data teams towards a unified understanding of metrics. Data challenges include schema mismatch, data type inconsistencies, and data granularity among others. The single source of truth is not a tool but the data itself, requiring a data-driven culture that understands metrics. The solution involves a social contract and a metric model that adapts to evolving data shapes and business needs. Thank you for reading Metric Stack Newsletter. This post is public so feel free to share it. Share Navigating the Marketing Technology (Martech) landscape is like charting a complex topography that's ever-changing. ChiefMartec's Marketing Technology Landscape is now populated with more than 11,000 companies and new tools are being discovered daily.&nbsp; This explosion in Martech is something that we witnessed first-hand: In 2014, when there were only about 900 vendors, we wrote an email to Scott Brinker asking to be included in the highly regarded report. At the time, Klipfolio was focused on data analytics for digital marketers and agencies -- so not only were we a vendor, we were also a service provider. Marketing technology is a broad field; it encompasses any software that marketers utilize in their daily work. With each new tool added to the Martech stack, marketers and data teams are inundated with disparate, often incompatible data sets. Martech can be highly disposable. This means marketers move from one platform to another, freely erasing rich data legacies while maintaining their reporting requirements. Are we any closer to solving this data challenge in 2023 than we were in 2014? In this post, we'll explore the difficulties in aligning marketing and data teams towards a unified understanding of their metrics, and delve into how to e...

**Content Preview:**
Summary: Metrics can be created, managed and consumed by data stacks containing a semantic layer, a metrics layer, or a hybrid solution. The choice of which system to use comes down to various factors such as: The current data infrastructure in the organization, the scale of the data being processed, the needs and experience of the data teams and data consumers, and the overall investment in data solutions. Thanks for reading Metric Stack Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Metrics provide a powerful way for analysts and decision makers to work with data that&#8217;s been curated and optimized for consumption. There are various technical solutions for metrics, making it challenging at times to understand which one is best for your organization and its data. This article helps you decide which path to choose by comparing and contrasting the primary technology types: Semantic layer , metric layer , and a hybrid approach that uses both. The semantic layer solution Semantic layers are making waves in the industry as the next evolution of data transformation toolkits for data teams. This technology creates a framework within which data teams define and manage metrics. The metrics are then made available to the decision makers, delineating the roles of data team and business team when it comes to an organization&#8217;s data. Some examples of such tools are dbt Semantic Layer from dbt Labs and Looker Modeller from Google. A semantic layer does not store data. Rather, it allows for meaning (metric definitions) and structure (semantics) to be assigned to data through added metadata. Metric definitions represent a consistent abstraction for the data in a way that&#8217;s easily understood and consumed. Part of this abstraction is a consistent and simplified way to query metrics that optimizes the consumption of the metric data for analysis. Semantic layers allow for metrics to be defined on top of the existing data in the data warehouse. ...

Summary: With that many self-serve analytics tools out there, why do business teams, like marketing or customer success, still frequently ask their data teams for dashboards? Truth is, a well-crafted dashboard addresses their needs in many ways that an organization&#8217;s self-serve analytics solution does not. This article describes the business team&#8217;s perspective on what true self-serve analytics should look like. Thanks for reading Metric Stack Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Self-serve business intelligence and analytics solutions are supposed to be designed for people like me. I&#8217;m the Chief Operating Officer at Klipfolio, and oversee the marketing and customer success teams that make data-driven decisions every day. Despite being part of an analytics company and fairly data-literate, I&#8217;m not a technical data specialist. My decision making, therefore, relies on clean, trusted data presented in a format my teams and I can understand and use. Unfortunately, the needs of end users are often an afterthought when discussing the challenges of modern business intelligence software. This needs to change. I firmly believe that keeping the end user in mind is key to developing a superior product. And, that includes self-serve analytics solutions. Based on my personal experience and interactions with our customers (team members from marketing, sales, or customer service) I&#8217;ve learned there&#8217;s one thing most of them want - dashboards. Sorry, data team! Please try to hold back your yawns &#128521;. Why dashboards? Because their needs are not being met by their current analytics solution. They keep coming back to the familiarity of dashboards as they try to accomplish these three things: Understand and communicate their data&#8217;s story Trust their data as a single source of truth Have access to a truly self-serve analytics tool that's straightforward to use I&#8217;m convinced there&#8217;s a way to nav...

**Published:** 2023-09-06T16:51:50+00:00

**Content Preview:**
Summary: Looking for the best way to make data-driven business decisions? Look no further! In this article, researcher Matthew Brown explains how data and business teams work together to build a library of essential business metrics. You&#8217;ll learn why metrics are well-suited for quantitative, unbiased data research - and - how having access to defined, consistent metrics means business teams can make decisions based on data, not instinct. Thanks for reading Metric Stack Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. What exactly is a metric? The term metric is often used interchangeably with measure or Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Even analysts sometimes struggle to understand the differences between these terms. However, as the popularity of metric analysis grows, more and more people are learning what makes metrics unique &#8211; metrics are both a data structure and a business concept. In his article on the benefits of metrics, senior software developer Graham Watts defines a metric as follows:&nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;A metric is a data structure that refers to a single, meaningful, measurable business concept. A metric includes the history of that value and the categories that the value can be broken down into (also called dimensions).&#8221;&nbsp; In most cases, a metric has multiple data points that have been or can be: aggregated (e.g., average room temperature over the last 12 hours),&nbsp; segmented (e.g., temperature on first floor vs. second floor), and/or&nbsp; combined with other measures (e.g., difference between room temperature and outdoor temperature).&nbsp; Business metrics are a subset of metrics that are commonly used to measure business health and help guide business decisions. If you&#8217;re not sure about the difference between measures, metrics, and KPIs, I recommend reading this informative comparison , written by Jonathan Taylor.

Summary: A metric describes both a data structure and a business concept. More and more analysts are discovering that using a well-defined metrics framework supports faster, more reliable decision making. In the world of big data, which often lacks meaning and structure, metrics are the key to success. The right amount of data, self-serve analytics, monitoring data over time, understanding and reacting to change, effectively combining disparate data sources in reports, and visualizing data for every team &#8211; Metrics include all this and more, enabling you to understand and gain insights into your data and business performance. Thanks for reading Metric Stack Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. The concept of metrics is gaining popularity in the analytics and business intelligence world. Metrics help data teams manage large amounts of data and make it easy for business teams to understand and access the information they need for confident decision making. However, some data experts may not realize the benefits of metrics when compared to traditional models. While there&#8217;s some good technical content out there about metrics, such as this article by Airbyte , our blog aims to help you understand what metrics are and why using them to measure and track your data will help you make the best business decisions.&nbsp; How metrics are different from traditional BI models A metric is a data structure that refers to a single, meaningful, measurable business concept . A metric includes the history of that value and the categories that the value can be broken down into (also called dimensions ). Let&#8217;s use a &#8220;Revenue&#8221; metric as an example. In the table below, you can see revenue by geography, department, and customer (the selected dimensions), for today&#8217;s date (current data), and for previous dates (historical data). Note that it doesn&#8217;t contain any data related to expenses &#8211; this would be measured...

## Post 465: Metric-centric BI - What it is and why it matters

**Publication:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**Author:** Metric Stack Newsletter

**Published:** 2023-07-25T19:05:18+00:00

**Content Preview:**
Summary The metric-centric BI approach provides a massive opportunity to bridge the current gaps between the needs of data and business teams when working with data. The baked-in metrics layer provides a trusted, clean, and governed single source of truth for all metrics in the organization. Business and data teams work in the same environment, encouraging collaboration and a mutual understanding of and investment in the company&#8217;s metrics. A purpose-built, no-code visualization layer enables a true self-serve BI experience.&nbsp; Thanks for reading Metric Stack Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. In a traditional business intelligence (BI) approach, data is accessed directly from a data warehouse. Whereas metric-centric BI adds a metrics definition layer that sits between the data warehouse and the visualization components. The metrics layer (sometimes called a semantic layer) is a relatively new concept in the modern data stack. A metric-centric BI approach includes a baked-in metrics layer where semantic meaning and metadata live alongside dashboards, reports, and data exploration. By recognizing the importance of metric visualization, metric-centric BI takes the concept of a metrics layer to the next level, achieving its full potential. The addition of a metrics layer enables data teams to quickly debug and edit metrics and data consumers to explore and visualize those metrics &#8211; all in the same environment. Not only does this make collaboration between teams easier, it will also reduce costs. This article describes the fundamental components of metric-centric BI and the benefits to both data and business teams. What is a metrics layer? The metrics layer is a central location for an organization&#8217;s metrics. It&#8217;s where business logic and semantic meaning is applied to data to create metrics. It&#8217;s also an organization&#8217;s single source of truth, where important metrics are defined, calculated, and...

## Post 466: The golden trio of web analytics

**Publication:** Metric Stack Newsletter

Pages per Session might not be the most glamorous or earth-shattering metric out there. But there are some key lessons to learn by tracking this metric. This week on Metric Stack, we'll look at the humble Pages per Session - and add a couple power-ups to help you extract insights that could potentially change your business for the better. Let's dig in: What is Pages per Session? Pages per Session tracks the average number of pages viewed per user session. In other words, this metric maps the percentage of sessions where users explore more than just a single page on your website. Here&#8217;s the formula: Pages per Session = Total Page Views / Total Sessions Just in case you need a refresher, a page view counts the number of times a page is loaded or reloaded. And a session is a period of time during which a user is active on a website. Bonus tip: there&#8217;s an FAQ section on the Pages per Session MetricHQ definition page with information specific to Google Analytics - check it out . What is a good Pages per Session benchmark? Based on 2021 benchmark data from Contentsquare , the global average Pages per Session across all industries is five. This means the average user session consists of around five pages loaded. Be aware that Pages per Session varies by industry. Because this metric is all about user intent - and that differs from industry to industry. Take a look at the chart to find the Pages per Session benchmark for your industry. Heads up - if you're B2B, it's much lower: Why should you care about Pages per Session? Look, when tracked in isolation, you&#8217;re not going to learn a whole lot from this metric. I&#8217;ll address a couple other metrics you should track along with Pages per Session for true, actionable insight. But let&#8217;s not write off Pages per Session. This metric gives you some crucial information all on its own: it gives you a glimpse at user behaviour. And if you&#8217;re been following the Metric Stack Newsletter for a while, you a...

## Post 467: How to define and track SaaS Activation Rate

**Publication:** Metric Stack Newsletter
**Author:** Priyaanka Arora

**Published:** 2022-02-08T15:00:32+00:00

**Content Preview:**
If you&#8217;re no stranger to SaaS, you&#8217;ve heard about activation and why it&#8217;s one of the most important &#8220;Pirate Metrics&#8221;. But have you ever stopped to think why? Or how to start tracking activation? In this edition of Metric Stack, we'll learn all about Activation Rate, look at benchmarks, and discover some ways to start effectively defining and measuring activation. What is Activation Rate? Activation Rate measures the percentage of &#8216;activated&#8217; users using your product. These users perform certain key actions in a fixed period of time indicating they have found true value within your product. Here&#8217;s the formula: Activation Rate = Users That Performed a Key Action / All Users Remember when you heard me mention pirate metrics? The pirate metrics - AARRR - describe the typical SaaS customer journey: Acquisition : here&#8217;s where you capture new trials, freemium users, and paying customers; acquisition is crucial for success and is considered the startup killer Activation : the stage where a light bulb goes off in the user&#8217;s head and they realize the true value of your product Retention : growing customer loyalty through excellent product experience and customer support Revenue : trial to paid, freemium to paid, up-sells, cross-sells, this stage is where users pay to use your product Referral : users bring in new users through word of mouth or direct referrals, completing the customer journey with the start of a new cycle But today, we're focusing on activation. Why? Because it's the bridge between acquisition and the rest of the customer journey. Low activation leaves very little revenue, retention, or referrals to speak about. What&#8217;s a good Activation Rate benchmark? According to Mixpanel&#8217;s 2019 Product Benchmarks Report , the median first week activation rate for SaaS is 17% , while the 90th percentile scores a whopping 65% activation rate. While benchmarks are super useful as guidance on what your met...

Welcome to edition 30 of the Metric Stack Newsletter! I&#8217;m Priyaanka Arora, and it&#8217;s my job to get you excited about all things metrics. Why? Because metrics are much, much more than random numbers pulled out of a magician&#8217;s hat. When utilized correctly, metrics are the difference between acting on your intuition alone and making informed decisions with a future vision in mind. Today on Metric Stack, we&#8217;ll look at one such metric that can seem straightforward but hides subtle complexities that make a ton of difference to how you measure success. Excited? Good! Let&#8217;s dig in: What is Trial Conversion Rate? Trial Conversion Rate is the percentage of free trial users that successfully convert to paid users. Here&#8217;s the formula: Trial Conversion Rate = Trial-to-Paid Users / Trial Users The formula is the easy part. Your next steps are to determine the length of your trial period (and whether that&#8217;s really the best duration), debate opt-in or opt-out, and, uh, decide whether you want to offer a trial at all (maybe?). Let&#8217;s figure out those answers one by one. That elusive perfect free trial length The industry still can&#8217;t come up with a definitive answer for one of the oldest problems in SaaS: what&#8217;s the optimal free trial length? Answers vary from the classic &#8220;it depends&#8221;, to anywhere between 7 and 30 days. Here are the top 3 factors that influence trial period length: Time to Value : how soon does the average user get to their first Aha! Moment when using the product? That gives you a rough estimate of how long your free trial could be. Customer Acquisition Cost : realistically, how long can you support free trial users before you start losing money? Remember that CAC is the startup killer , increasing steadily year after year. Balance your costs against revenue from free-to-paid conversions. Ease of use: how easy is it to set up and use the product? The time &amp; effort needed to onboard, configure,...

Some of you might feel it&#8217;s too early in the week to understand the subtle differences between two similar sounding words. But I don&#8217;t think so! In this edition of the Metric Stack Newsletter, you&#8217;ll learn how to measure Email Delivery through two key metrics, Email Bounce Rate &amp; Inbox Placement Rate. As always, I&#8217;ll take you through the latest industry benchmarks - so read on! Let&#8217;s start with some definitions: What is Email Bounce Rate? Email Bounce Rate measures the percentage of unsuccessful email deliveries resulting from each email you send. Here&#8217;s the formula: Email Bounce Rate = Email Bounces / Emails Sent You might have heard of unsuccessful email deliveries through another name: Email Bounces.&nbsp; And there are a couple flavours: Email Hard Bounces happen when there are permanent, irreversible problems such as incorrect email addresses on your list or email service shut downs. Email Soft Bounces are much more temporary and occur due to issues such as server down time and full inboxes. Essentially, Email Bounce Rate is your go-to metric for measuring email delivery . What&#8217;s the difference between email delivery and email deliverability? Email delivery is when your email successfully reaches your recipient&#8217;s inbox. That includes the spam folder! Measure email delivery with the Email Bounce Rate metric. Email deliverability is the art of sending emails that land in your recipient&#8217;s primary email inbox - or at least in promotions. Any email that lands in junk or spam folders is said to have low deliverability. Measure email deliverability with the Inbox Placement Rate metric. Which metric should you prioritize? I&#8217;d say start with Email Bounce Rate first to ensure your email is actually reaching inboxes, and then focus on getting placed in the primary inbox. More tips on how to achieve both delivery and deliverability later, but first: benchmarks! What&#8217;s a good Email Bounce Rate benchmark? ...

You Said to Use DuckDB On Small Data Previously, I was a champion of using DuckDB for any dataset that was &#8220;small&#8221; (&lt; 20GBs). Recently, I was challenged on that remark on LinkedIn by some astute data engineers, who said I had a misconception about what DuckDB was capable of. Being the curious data engineer I am, I took a bite on that bait and decided to roll up my sleeves and benchmark much larger datasets.

Not everything you learned in college about data warehousing still applies in 2025. This is part 2 of Sahar&#8217;s unlearning data warehousing concepts series. (make sure to read part 1 first if you haven&#8217;t &#8220;The Data Setup No One Ever Taught You&#8221; series ) Sahar and I learned a lot during out time working in core growth together at Facebook working in friending and notifications. DataExpert.io Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Let&#8217;s talk about the pain of unlearning and then let&#8217;s get to the magic. Imagine you&#8217;re an analyst at a social media company. The retention team asks: &#8220;For users who now have 1000+ followers but had under 200 three months ago &#8211; what device were they primarily using back then? And of the posts they viewed during that growth period, how many were from accounts that were mutuals at the time ?&#8221; You need to join user data (follower counts then and now), device data (primary device then and now), relationships (who was a mutual then vs now), and post views &#8211; all as of 3 months ago. With most data warehouse setups, this query is somewhere between &#8220;nightmare&#8221; and &#8220;impossible.&#8221; &nbsp; You&#8217;re dealing with state, not actions. State in the past, across multiple tables. There&#8217;s a word for this problem &#8211; slowly changing dimensions. Whole chapters of textbooks deal with various approaches. You could try logs (if you logged the right stuff). You could try slowly changing dimensions with ` valid_from / valid_to ` dates. You could try separate history tables. All of these approaches are painful, error-prone, and make backfilling a living hell. There&#8217;s a better way. Through the magic of &#10024; datestamps &#10024; and idempotent pipelines, this query becomes straightforward. And backfills? They become a button you push.

I&#8217;m an old coworker of Zach&#8217;s from Facebook. This is our story. ( Part two is here ) Data engineering can actually be easy, fast, and resilient! All you have to embrace is a simple concept: Date-stamping all your data. DataExpert.io Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Why isn&#8217;t this the norm? Because &#8211; even in 2025 &#8212; , institutions haven&#8217;t really understood the implications that STORAGE IS CHEAP! (And your data team&#8217;s time is expensive ). Datestamping solves so many problems . But you won&#8217;t find it in a standard textbook. They&#8217;ll teach you &#8220; slowly changing dimensions Type 2 &#8221; when the real answer is simpler and more powerful. You will find the answer in Maxime Beauchemin&#8217;s seminal article on functional data engineering. Here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; I love Max , but that article is not helpful to the majority of people who could learn from it. What if I told you: We can have resilient pipelines. We can master changes to data over time. We can use One Weird Trick to marry the benefits of order and structure with the benefits of chaos and exploration. That&#8217;s where this article comes in. It&#8217;s been 7 years in the making &#8211; all the stuff that you should know, but no one bothered to tell you yet. (At least, in plain english &#8211; sorry Max!) Part One: How to set up a simple warehouse (and which small bits of jargon actually matter) Part Two: Date-stamping . Understand this and everyone&#8217;s life will become easier, happier, and 90% more bug-free. Part Three: Plugging metrics into AB testing. Warehousing enables experimentation. Exper...

There are some conversations that confirm what you already believe, and then there are conversations that take what you believe and frame it in a way that makes it actionable, precise and inevitable. That&#8217;s what happened when I sat down with Chip Huyen during a Tech Talk we held at DataExpert.io AI Engineering Boot Camp. Chip is an AI researcher, former big tech engineer, best-selling author and one of the most lucid thinkers on AI systems working today. Recently, she&#8217;s been in the public spotlight with her new book AI Engineering , which has quickly become the most comprehensive, well-structured guide to the essential aspects of building generative AI systems (we covered a lot of its content in the boot camp too). This talk was neither a book launch nor a formal Q&amp;A. It was a honest, refreshing &amp; grounded conversation that can be distilled into seven core takeaways, each one capturing ideas Chip shared that stuck with me, challenged me or reshaped how I think about building and leading in AI. This article covers the following: Chip&#8217;s journey into AI Where most GenAI products go wrong The underrated value of UX How to build functional AI agents What really takes to ship value in the modern AI stack. How to stay informed without burning out Building with clarity and conviction If you want to learn from other brilliant minds like Chip, we are launching a 10-week Challenge Boot Camp on Sep 15th where will be covering insightful tech talks with 15 industry leaders in the data, analytics and AI engineering space.

## Post 480: Stopping Silent Failures for Meta's Fake Accounts Pipeline

**Publication:** DataExpert.io Newsletter
**Author:** Zach Wilson
**URL:** https://blog.dataexpert.io/p/saving-metas-fake-accounts-pipeline
**Published:** 2025-08-12T19:38:14+00:00

**Content Preview:**
One of my final projects at Facebook was owning the data pipeline that tracked fake accounts. It may sound simple but, in reality, it was one of the most deceptively complex orchestration problems I&#8217;ve ever encountered and made worst by a hidden upstream design choice that prioritized speed of delivery over data consistency. Fake accounts come and go. Some are flagged incorrectly, others are later verified, and many are caught by internal ML systems. The goal of our pipeline was to trace the inflows and outflows of fake accounts daily. That meant building a reliable dataset that could track: Accounts unlabeled as fake (i.e. after submitting a valid ID) Accounts relabeled as fake Accounts flagged as fake for the first time Accounts that remained fake The pattern was very straightforward: a classic cumulative table design. But the way it was wired to upstream data, specifically how it &#8220;waited&#8221; for inputs, created a non-deterministic nightmare. For weeks, I chased what I thought was a bug in my code, only to discover that the real problem had been there from day one. In this article, I&#8217;ll cover the following aspects: Why relying on &#8220;latest&#8221; partition data broke everything How upstream non-deterministic leads to silent data mismatches The simple fix using explicit partition dates The tradeoff between latency and reproducibility Engineering lessons that go beyond code If you want to learn more in depth about patterns like this, the DataExpert.io academy subscription has 200+ hours of content about system design, streaming pipelines, etc. The first 5 people can use code FAKE for 30% off!

In my time at Facebook, I worked on Notifications which, along with Messages and Ads , was the most volume-heavy pipeline in the company. Every ping you get from likes, tags, shares, comments, events is backed by mountains of notification data. One of my most challenging assignments was owning the pipeline that deduplicated all notification events. This dataset drove downstream metrics like CTRs, conversions, and even machine learning signal quality. This pipeline presented one big problem: it was slow. Very, very slow. When I joined Facebook, the deduped notifications pipeline ran a giant Hive GROUP BY job once a day at UTC midnight which took 9.5 hours to complete. This latency issue represented a huge bottleneck for all downstream models in the Core Growth team. This article is the story of how I brought 9.5-hour latency down to 45 minutes , and what it taught me about I/O, orchestration, and never trusting a &#8220;simple&#8221; DAG. Here I&#8217;ll be covering the following: Why streaming deduplication at scale failed The hourly dedup job that exploded compute usage A tree-based DAG design that saved the day Key orchestration lessons from building a 300-step daily DAG How this project got me promoted and why I almost gave up If you want to learn more in depth about patterns like this, the DataExpert.io academy subscription has 200+ hours of content about system design, streaming pipelines, etc. The first 5 people can use code DEDUP for 30% off!

The Stakes: Notifications at Facebook Scale The notif_events table contained every event tied to a notification: Sent to your phone Delivered to device Clicked Converted Since one person might click the same notification multiple times , we had to dedup those. If we counted every click, we&#8217;d get click-through rates above 100%, which negatively impacted metric tracking an...

## Post 483: How I cut Airbnb's Pricing pipeline backfill time 95%

**Content Preview:**
I spent over three years at Airbnb as Staff Engineer for Marketplace Dynamics , owning everything related to pricing, availability &amp; profitability. One of my biggest projects was overhauling the Pricing &amp; Availability pipeline. Among other things, I was fixing definitions, squashing time zone bugs and rethinking orchestration to turn weeks-long backfills into hours. In this deep dive, I&#8217;ll walk you through the challenges I faced, the architectural mistakes I inherited and the solutions that made Airbnb earn millions. This article covers the following topics: The subtle nuance in &#8216;availability&#8217; definitions The original P&amp;A pipeline design and its pain points Why massive backfills were so slow (and expensive) Introducing staging tables for rapid iteration What valuable lessons I learned The business impact of my work and some personal reflections There&#8217;s a summary infographic of the entire data orchestration pipeline at the end of this article!

The True meaning of &#8220;Available&#8221; Airbnb&#8217;s legacy definition of an &#8220;available&#8221; night was simply: A host has not blocked this night, and it is not already reserved On the surface, that sounds reasonable but, in reality, it diverged from what guests actually could book. Therefore, Airbnb aimed to establish a more reliable meaning of what&#8217;s &#8220;available&#8221;. A trip can be booked that contains this night. In fact, the two definitions only matched 96% of the time. But this subtle change captures the nuances between both definitions. Key edge cases: Minimum stay requirements : Hosts or local regulations (e.g., 30-day minimum in New York) made many unblocked nights unbookable. Last minute/ time zone bugs : The system evaluated availability one second before midnight UTC. So Asia or Europe-based listings were someti...

SQL and data engineering are like peanut butter and jelly. In every single data engineering role I&#8217;ve ever had, I&#8217;ve been asked SQL questions for at least an hour. This is a round that I personally feel very confident in since I have never failed it. In this newsletter, I&#8217;ll be covering the key details that you&#8217;ll need to know to pass these common interviews. What are the types of SQL interviews in big tech companies Big tech companies like to ask a lot of questions from their engineers. There are usually two types of interviews for SQL. EcZachly Data Engineering Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The screener interview This interview is 45-60 minutes. The questions here are usually pretty easy compared to the onsite round. The goal here is to show that yes, you can code in SQL. Answering the questions is usually enough to pass the round. The onsite SQL interview This interview is 60 minutes. The questions here go more in-depth. You&#8217;ll be asked a lot about table scans and optimizations. It&#8217;s unlikely your first solution will be the most optimal one. The screener interview in detail In the screener interview, they usually ask four to five questions: A simple question that requires a WHERE condition with a GROUP BY. This question is mostly to build your confidence and to give everyone who interviews a small win even if they don&#8217;t pass. A question that requires you to do a JOIN + aggregation Make sure to be able to talk about the differences between LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, and FULL OUTER JOIN. If you don&#8217;t know the differences, you won&#8217;t pass A question that requires you to do a window function The most common question here is the &#8220; second highest salary &#8221; question.

Whenever you&#8217;re building a data system, there&#8217;s a million things to consider. Gone are the days of just shoving everything into MongoDB and calling it &#8220;web scale.&#8221; In this newsletter, we&#8217;ll be going over the considerations you should be thinking about when building out large scale data systems. Systems have different needs and functionality Data systems can be living and breathing in real-time like the Uber app with a data latency of milliseconds. Or they can be incredibly slow to update like the US census with a data latency of ten years! Why doesn&#8217;t Uber design their system like the US Census? I think it has something to do with the fact that ordering an Uber 10 years ahead of time isn&#8217;t classified as a &#8220;normal human behavior.&#8221; Okay, but what about the other way around? Why doesn&#8217;t the US Census design their data system like Uber? Wouldn&#8217;t having extremely up-to-date information on the population be beneficial? For the US Census, the benefit of real-time data isn&#8217;t strong enough for managing the complexity. Imagine every single mortuary, hospital, and mid-wife would need an app to say, &#8220;yep this person died&#8221; or &#8220;yep this person was born.&#8221; Even if we set aside privacy concerns, getting that adopted across the entire country would be extremely cumbersome without that much benefit.

Now that we&#8217;ve established that both data systems have pretty good reasons for why they do things the way they do. Determining your systems needs When architecting a data system, there are three needs that are the most critical in determining which technologies you should select: Latency If your data system needs to be extremely low latency (&lt;10 seconds as a cutoff), your system needs to be architected as a &#8220;push&#8221; syst...

## Post 490: 2026 - the year of AGI

**Published:** 2026-01-13T15:45:39+00:00

**Content Preview:**
The year of narrow AGI My prediction for this year is that we will see AGI within specific settings. I think many people get the term AGI confused with ASI. Artificial General Intelligence is not Artificial Super Intelligence. ASI conjures images of an all-powerful, perhaps sentient AI. In my mind, AGI is something quite different. It is a system that can do many different things at least as well as a human. There is no requirement for sentience. It needs to be able to do some things it is asked to do or has a predefined directive for. What does &#8220;at least as well as a human&#8221; mean? It does not mean perfectly. I am, by definition, generally intelligent, but there is almost nothing I do perfectly. There is no value in an AGI that can do many things worse than the average human, but there is tremendous value in one that can do many things as well as or better than average. If you have worked in typical workplaces, not elite tech companies, you will know this is a pretty low bar. I have worked at companies where people do not come back from the pub at lunch. Or worse, they do and work whilst being many times over the limit to drive a car. I have worked at companies where I had to do someone else&#8217;s job as well as my own whilst they were on vacation, and I did not even feel the extra load because they did that little, or I was able to automate their work with a VBA macro. I think people doing jobs like these, rather badly, make up a huge percentage of our workforce. Well over 10%. The ability to learn What do I mean by &#8220;many things&#8221;? It is clearly not all things. I am generally intelligent and have limited specific capabilities. What makes me generally intelligent is my ability to learn to do many different things that I cannot do right now, and could not do when I was born. So an AGI system, more than anything, will have to be able to learn to do new things, and retain and maintain the knowledge of how to do those things so it can execute act...

&#8217;s 2026 prediction for LLMs raised something that&#8217;s been rattling around my head.

I&#8217;ve been thinking about which jobs are effectively finished because of advances in AI. In short, any work that is repetitive, has abundant public training data, and mostly maps language input to language output is at serious risk. Law is the clearest example. That does not mean all lawyers are finished, but the impact is already visible: hiring of law graduates into junior roles has dropped sharply. The picture, however, is more nuanced. Partner-level roles (including public-sector equivalents) will remain essential for as long as legal services are delivered to humans. These roles are fundamentally about sales, judgement, accountability and human interaction&#8212;none of which it is reasonable to delegate fully to AI without some implausible humanoid interface. Even so, partners alone are not enough. Senior lawyers just below partner level do the real orchestration: validating work, making decisions, and ensuring quality. That layer is also essential. The layers below that&#8212;junior and mid-level roles where people are not yet trusted to work independently and whose output requires senior review&#8212;are the most exposed. There is little doubt that AI will handle this work in the near future, faster and better than humans. The main reasons it has not yet happened are institutional caution and slow adoption of agent-based systems, both understandable in law. Once secure systems can guarantee confidentiality and a baseline level of quality, this work will move to AI. It is an ideal use case for agents: contextualising a matter, retrieving minimal relevant statutes and case law, and coordinating specialised sub-agents under human supervision. So what happens to junior and mid-level lawyers? They do not disappear entirely. Partners and seniors are human: they retire, move on, and occasionally die in post. Organisations therefore need a pipeline to replace them. Assume a legal organisation loses around 10% of its partners and seniors each year. To replenish ...

Recently, Character.ai faced a lawsuit for failing to provide adequate protections for users. &#8216;I want them to understand that this is a platform that the designers chose to put out without proper guardrails, safety measures or testing, and it is a product that is designed to keep our kids addicted and to manipulate them,&#8217; Garcia said in an interview with CNN. Garcia alleges that Character.ai &#8211; which markets its technology as &#8216;AI that feels alive&#8217; &#8211; knowingly failed to implement proper safety measures to prevent her son from developing an inappropriate relationship with a chatbot that caused him to withdraw from his family. The lawsuit also claims that the platform did not adequately respond when Setzer began expressing thoughts of self-harm to the bot, according to the complaint filed in federal court in Florida. The frustrating thing about this is that we have been walking this path for a long time. I am part of the Smartphone Free Childhood movement in my local area, and the primary danger we have focused on is the harm caused by algorithmic feeds in social media that indirectly influence children down darker paths and can lead to humiliation when content about them is shared and spread. Character.ai seems to have taken a similar approach to user engagement using an AI agent &#8211; but the danger here is how direct it is. LLMs are trained to please, so if someone asks about suicide, expresses interest in it, and says they want help to do it, LLMs will output what is most likely and relevant to the user&#8217;s request &#8211; unless you build guardrails. The flipside of being part of the Smartphone Free Childhood movement is that I am also active in building software with AI and developing agents to benefit professionals. What really frustrates me is that it is actually fairly straightforward to take measures to make products like Character.ai safer and to establish solid guardrails. Nothing involving AI will ever be 100% safe ...

I was interested to try out ChatGPT Atlas, like many people. I genuinely wasn&#8217;t sure of the point of the product, which actually made it more interesting to me, as usually the point of a new product is quite clear. Upon downloading, installing and opening the macOS app, I was underwhelmed. It&#8217;s just a fairly basic browser experience. I don&#8217;t see why it would have such a draw that people would switch over, learn new keyboard shortcuts, and move bookmarks and passwords 1 . Sure, it&#8217;s nice to be able to open the panel and use ChatGPT in context, but it&#8217;s not that much harder than copying and pasting text or links into the ChatGPT tab I always have open. Of course, ChatGPT may become more helpful as it observes your browsing habits, but this also has security implications. Perhaps it could discover new and interesting content based on what you&#8217;ve been reading and asking it to summarise or interact with. Perhaps it could even identify more interesting material when it notices that you&#8217;ve read it yourself rather than asking for a summary. It might eventually offer entirely synthesised content that exists only for you&#8212;tailored to your interests but still anchored in the &#8216;truth&#8217; of existing content 2 . It&#8217;s like a series of conversion steps of interest: clicked the link, looked at the content, scrolled a bit, asked ChatGPT about it or to summarise it, read it yourself, shared it. The perfect dataset to build a recommender system. Still, I didn&#8217;t think it would be that impactful as a launch. I don&#8217;t believe the current benefits balance with the drawbacks enough to persuade people to move from their favourite browser. After all, your favourite browser is like your favourite brand of underwear&#8212;are you really going to switch if you&#8217;re comfy? Then the other, and perhaps main, purpose of Atlas dawned on me. I wanted ChatGPT to summarise a blog post I couldn&#8217;t be bothered to read. When ...

Photo by Victor Lu on Unsplash A couple of weeks ago, we were all wondering if a certain insider scoop was for real&#8230; Founders were saying it was, that the source was too well-connected. Others were saying it made sense, Tristan and George are friends, they&#8217;re stronger together, Fivetran would then own all the modern data stack transformation tech&#8230; and so on. Well, Day 1 of dbt Coalesce confirmed the rumours - dbt Labs and Fivetran are indeed merging . Before the Big Data era which preceded the Modern Data Stack era, we had four monolithic data stacks: Teradata, MS SQL Server, Oracle and IBM. They couldn&#8217;t handle the size of the post dot.com era clickstream datasets, but they did have the ability to do everything in one stack&#8230; even if badly. You could make reports with SSRS, and perhaps their style would now be called &#8216;retro&#8217;. You could run analytical queries with Oracle databases, the one I learned SQL on in 2010. You could ETL using Excel, VBA and SSIS&#8230; it was bad and took days to run, but you could do it. Looking at the stack below, you see all the same pieces save a query engine. Now, with truly decoupled storage and compute with the widespread adoption of Iceberg, it need only be a query engine. It looks very similar to Databricks, but without query engines of course. I feel like we&#8217;re entering a new era of cloud monolithic stacks. Fivetran-dbt, GCP, Microsoft Fabric, Databricks and Snowflake. After all, the only reason the original era of on-prem data platforms ended was because of their inability to handle large datasets and unwillingness to modernise and risk cannibalising their own business models. Those companies had the capital and talent to build cloud data warehouses and use columnar storage, but they didn&#8217;t want to upset their business models. Microsoft&#8217;s Fabric business line and Oracle&#8217;s analytics business line are still probably bigger than all but Databricks and Snowflake in the ...

Photo by Markus Winkler on Unsplash Over the last few years, I have really wanted to have an open standard for semantic layers. Something that would make semantic layer definition code (probably YAML) portable, to be used between BI tools, standalone semantic layers and other data products. In a way, open-source Cube has been this in the past, it is a very well-used open-source project with known users in pretty much all big tech companies. However, it has never had enough support from other BI tools which, along with the drive towards AI, led to Cube pursuing their own agentic BI tool in Cube Cloud. I have also been critical of newer technologies like Malloy, which have similar aims to semantic layers but seemed less practical. My thinking was that getting users to learn a new DSL when we already have SQL, YAML, MDX, DAX&#8230; was a bad idea and doomed to fail. However, with AI, perhaps value can be had. If Malloy is like a tool to be used by AI and core definitions also maintained by AI, then no new DSL needs to be learned by any human. Out comes a new standard, spearheaded by Snowflake, Salesforce(Tableau) and others - the Open Semantic Interchange. Surely, this is great news. I should be really pleased, right? sent me the article announcing it and asked me if I thought it was a big deal before I had seen it on LinkedIn 1 . The thing is, I&#8217;m not that bothered, and I had to think for a moment as to why. I&#8217;m sure it would have felt like bigger news had I still been at Cube, but even so&#8230; Then it dawned on me - this level of standardisation is much more valuable when human beings are having to learn the DSL. It makes them much less worried that they are learning or deploying something that ends up being niche or unadopted. I don&#8217;t really believe that semantic layer code will be managed by humans in the near term. Now that I have great tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI, I don&#8217;t really find myself writing semantic layer YAML any more. ...

As many of you will have heard, the company that looked after SQLGlot and SQLMesh, Tobiko Data, was recently acquired by Fivetran - one of the biggest companies to have come out of the modern data stack era. Now that the dust has settled - it&#8217;s been a couple of weeks since the announcement - I thought it would be good to evaluate what it means for data folks and how I feel about it in general. There is one sense in which I have no conflict in my thinking. I have got to know the Tobiko team since starting my series on SQLMesh, having since overseen real deployments. I&#8217;m very happy for them in the sense that they built something great, and that they have had what I assume is a successful 1 exit&#129761;. After all, the reality of founding companies, especially in VC, is that the company will one day be sold and investors and founders make money. I know people don&#8217;t like to be so explicit about this: they like to talk about the mission and that they&#8217;re building a company not to be acquired, but to become a public company&#8230; one with its own tower in San Francisco, with its logo lit up for the whole city to see. There are very few such companies&#8230; you probably know most of their names. Most VC-backed companies that have a successful exit are acquired. These exits aren&#8217;t so glamorous, they don&#8217;t get to ring the bell at the stock exchange, the founders end up taking middle-management roles at the acquirer with a length of lock-in&#8230; they might get a cool LinkedIn announcement and article in TechCrunch. So that&#8217;s fine, from an economic point of view everything makes sense for Tobiko as a company and that&#8217;s why it happened. What about for us data folks? So this is where, even with a bit of time passed, I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good for us. As much as Fivetran are currently saying that the open source SQLMesh and SQLGlot projects will remain and be maintained&#8230; I don&#8217;t expect this to be the c...

This week, I travelled to Berlin to speak at Data Days Berlin. It was organised by a data consultancy called A11, which has recently spun out of a VC fund called Project A, who had originally built this consultancy for portfolio companies. This is the first year that the conference has been open to people outside of Project A portcos, and it was really great to attend and speak. Everything from the venue to the social events was really enjoyable, too! The conference audience was curated by the organising team to filter to people accomplished in the data industry, which made it a really great bunch of people to meet and to present to. When I asked: &#8220;Who knows what a semantic layer in data is?&#8221;, more than half the audience put their hands up, which is unusual. I have spoken to audiences at data events where less than half know what SQL is. The speaker&#8217;s dinner was at a restaurant based in a building which was where the anti-capitalist movement in Berlin gathered. The dining room we were in had lots of the graffiti and messaging preserved from this era! The talks I managed to catch were high quality. They seemed to be split between impact focus and how to operate data in organisations to drive value, alongside technical excellence and innovation. This is logical, because data leaders need to be able to excel both as technologists and business people. Strangely, I feel this AI era means we actually need to be better at both at the same time. Tools like Claude Code, Cursor etc make us more capable of doing our technical work and allow us to be more ambitious. Vendors we use are rapidly releasing new features for us to, in turn, share with our stakeholders. Our stakeholders are clear about what they want. They want AI access to accurate, consistent data. They think this will be by MCP in ChatGPT Enterprise/MS Copilot/Claude Desktop. They still want us to be responsible and accountable for the provision of this access and the quality of the outputs.

## Post 499: Get on your soapbox

For the vast majority of human history, the main way to address many people in order to share public information was to stand on a hill or a platform, in a space where as many people as possible could hear you and you could speak to them. There is obvious evidence of this scattered around the world: Red Square, Tiananmen Square, St Peter&#8217;s Square, Roman amphitheatres... Part of why this is the case is that for most of human history, whilst we&#8217;ve always had language, most humans haven&#8217;t been literate. So you had to be heard directly by them if you wanted to share a message, and didn&#8217;t want to rely on second hand relaying. The maximum number of people you can address directly is in the tens of thousands unamplified, which, before the 20th century, was how all addresses happened. In theory, it&#8217;s since become possible to fill a giant plain or field with tens of millions of people and, with amplification, address them, but there is a limit to what you could really call &#8216;direct&#8217;. At some number, most people will be seeing the speaker on a screen and hearing through speakers and then it&#8217;s functionally the same as watching an address live at the cinema with others. Television addresses then extended this to be able to address pretty much anyone who is awake to watch, which is dependent on timezone and people having televisions and electricity. The internet then extended this further, to anyone who has an internet connection and can find the address: think YouTube live streams where hundreds of millions can watch big events. Finally, if you think about asynchronous content like blog posts, viral social posts etc, then the whole connected world could see these, and it then comes down to whether they&#8217;re interested or not. The problem with addressing more and more people with the same content is relevance. The more people you address, the less relevant it is to the average person addressed. There are exceptions to this, like...

Photo by Ricardo Rocha on Unsplash Today marks my last day at Cube. Firstly, I&#8217;d like to say thank you to everyone I&#8217;ve worked with there and who ultimately provided Michael and I with an exit where we were able to make all our investors whole and to continue to work on applying AI to semantic layers. I&#8217;m lucky enough to be in a position that I am able to make ends meet from my other income. So please don&#8217;t take this as one of those posts eliciting sympathy for a difficult situation post-job, this is not the case - I&#8217;m just reflecting. I still believe that Cube has the best universal semantic layer out there, and it is the only fully functional open source one of enough significance to be considered an open standard. Godspeed to the Cube team as they continue on their agentic analytics journey. I truly wish them the best and every success on this journey. I still believe that semantic layers are important and even more so than when I first started writing about them a few years ago. I still remember the magic of using LookML for the first time in 2019. It&#8217;s been a bumpy road for semantic layers in that time, but now that the impetus from agentic analytics is driving our industry forward, this time by stakeholders dragging us forward instead of technologists, I think we&#8217;re nearly there. Every cloud data platform provider now except AWS&#8230; Databricks, Snowflake, GCP, MSFabric, now have a semantic layer of some form that isn&#8217;t just a knowledge graph but also has a compiler. The question I have for the future is whether the semantic layer needs to be seen or can fade into the background. Semantic layers need to exist and need to be codified and compiled, but does that mean humans need to see it or touch it directly? Can AI maintain semantic layers in an invisible way for normal operation? Sure, if you ask the definition of a metric or how the data model fits together, it can answer you. This doesn&#8217;t have to mean ...

There has been a lot of discussion about whether junior engineering roles of all kinds will disappear completely. You may have read some of my recent posts and thought that my point of view was that they would disappear, but it&#8217;s not quite so binary as that. I can see that high-growth early-stage companies may never hire junior engineers again, but they are quite small companies and didn&#8217;t really hire juniors much anyway, because they didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to train them. The other driving force is that large tech companies are laying off and not hiring as many engineers, and they are definitely not hiring juniors in the same way anymore. Previously, graduates from Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, etc in CompSci didn&#8217;t have to look hard for work after graduating, if they had to look at all. The big tech companies would look to hire as many of these graduates as possible to enter their graduate schemes and fill the pipeline of future labour they would need. This is clearly no longer happening, mostly because tech companies don&#8217;t believe they will need as many humans in the future. However, I doubt they aren&#8217;t hiring any junior engineers at all... They&#8217;re probably still hiring at least 10% of the graduates they used to, and perhaps these are the very best who, during their time in education, had already built a lot of things and contributed meaningfully to open source software, etc. In traditional industries, this reduction in hiring is probably not nearly as severe. I doubt large banks have significantly changed their hiring practices in the past year. In traditional industries, I think at least 50% of junior engineering positions in a given year would still exist. So, clearly, this is not an extinction. It&#8217;s a reduction. One thing that I think we are very close to achieving is having AI-augmented engineers capable of handling a significantly larger volume of work than engineers of 4 years ago. O...

Photo by Anna Saveleva on Unsplash I wrote the initial part of this article in June&#8230; things move fast in the AI world! Recently, I heard the news that Anthropic had removed first-party access to Windsurf. Anthropic&#8217;s Claude 3.5+ models have been the ones that I have mostly used in Windsurf and Cursor, so this news is somewhat disconcerting. If I wanted to use Claude in proactive AI coding 1 workflows, I&#8217;ll have to use another tool like Cursor, Void or nao. I&#8217;ve had such good results using these Claude models for this workflow that I haven&#8217;t felt the need to try Gemini 2.5 Pro yet, but it looks like I will end up doing that sooner rather than later. A few weeks ago, I wrote about how I thought that Windsurf joining OpenAI could open a whole raft of possible advantages in terms of better model access, specialised model creation for different Windsurf flow states, and just raw GPU muscle for the Windsurf team to use to build new models of their own - which it turns out they were doing long before the acquisition. This development reveals the darker and more troubling side of the situation. Despite many thousands or even hundreds of thousands of Windsurf users enjoying Anthropic models in Windsurf, who have no additional affiliation with OpenAI prior to the acquisition, Anthropic (clearly for competitive reasons) has decided to revoke access. This isn&#8217;t unexpected; Windsurf essentially serves as both a training data generator and a tool for coding. It continuously generates context for AI-generated code, including the code that was actually generated, as well as various approximate and direct confirmations of quality. It&#8217;s very easy to generate a huge training set where Anthropic&#8217;s models have generated the code, and it has been confirmed to be good. This training set is then used to build Windsurf&#8217;s own models. Clearly, this was tolerable to Anthropic while Windsurf was independent, but now, faced with the possibili...

They&#8217;re over there somewhere There are lot of people out there saying that this is the end of software and data engineering, and that these jobs will not exist in the near future. I&#8217;m not sure that this will be the case. I think what is more likely is that we will use fewer humans to do more work and after this progresses to a certain point, the cost savings from having fewer humans diminishes. Imagine having one staff/principal engineer working with AI/agents or whatever the next thing will be, doing the work of 10 or more engineers in the pre-AI era. This kind of force multiplier is almost certainly possible. There are huge benefits in only having one engineer in an engineering team. One engineer can essentially move at whatever speed they like, they don&#8217;t have to bring everyone else with them. They don&#8217;t have to spend loads of time on documentation and meetings. They don&#8217;t have to share context. They don&#8217;t have to train up junior engineers 1 . Having this one staff/principal engineer will not cost anything like having the 10 engineer team with management costs. It will most likely cost less than 10% of the old-style team. Largely, this could translate to it costing less than one tenth of what it used to, to build the product. Making this kind of saving in operating cost is too attractive for any company to miss and we are seeing companies around the world already start to move this way. However, trying to have another order of magnitude of savings is much less appealing. You then only save 90% of the cost of one engineer or maybe a bit less, as the engineer doing the equivalent of a 100 person pre-AI engineering team can ask for a fortune in package that the engineer doing the equivalent of 10 can&#8217;t. It starts to get perilous, too. Many companies don&#8217;t have 100 engineers. If you only have one engineer, what happens when they leave? AI is not in a place to be entirely responsible for engineering at companies yet, nor...

credit: The Matrix Reloaded - Warner Bros In December, when I worked on my SQLMesh advent series, I used Windsurf as an IDE, but within Windsurf was Cascade. I didn&#8217;t think about Cascade as an agent too much but it clearly is! You proactively ask it to achieve something and then it goes and does it, and it might require multiple steps, multiple files to be made, multiple dependencies to be handled and multiple errors to be overcome&#8230; but it tries to build something that works. It was able to build a fairly complicated data pipeline, a transformation project in SQLMesh 1 , and then assist me in developing software to generate a semantic layer using AI from the gold layer tables within the transformation project. My inclination was to build software to do this at the time and use AI to help me build software that was able to repeatedly perform the same task. However, even this software wasn&#8217;t deterministic; it depended on LLM use. What if I didn&#8217;t try to generate code at all and just tried to get to the output? Just ask the agent for what you want. Recently, I had an experience of trying something like this that made me think this is now feasible. Warp is an AI-first terminal that recently released V2 of their product to much fanfare, and the core of the new functionality is the ability to build agents. In this instance, I used Warp to build my agent. asked me to produce some content about recent releases to Cube&#8217;s new agentic analytics product - D3. However, one problem with a product that is moving fast is a lack of documentation. We have the code in Github and merged commits that show what changes have made it into prod, we have tickets in Linear that are pretty sparse on detail&#8230; we have some element of high-level strategy but not much else. Initially, we thought it would be best if Artyom filled in a Notion document with new releases that have been merged on any given day, and perhaps create a rough Loom or have the engineer who ...

The semantic layer came of age over the course of two weeks at the Moscone Center. Both Snowflake, with semantic views, and Databricks, with metrics views, have essentially implemented a semantic layer with a compiler, which I predicted (around this time last year) that they would do before the end of 2025. Back then, both Snowflake and Databricks had implemented ways of codifying a knowledge graph, which looked very much like semantic layer YAML, except that this YAML was not compiled in the same way as with a semantic layer 1 . It was provided as context in the prompt so that the text-to-SQL methods they were employing could perform better. They did indeed perform better, but as I wrote about before, they still didn&#8217;t come close to the text-to-semantic layer method I had proposed and that has been implemented at Delphi and Cube. They never will come close to the text-to-semantic layer method and, as a result, will never have high enough accuracy to succeed. This is why I predicted that Snowflake and Databricks would change tack in 2025, and indeed why they have done so. The driver for this change is agentic analytics. When the idea of headless BI, or a universal semantic layer, first made its way into the zeitgeist of data folks, it was meant for use by BI tools and data applications. It may have originated in natural language, like with Cube&#8217;s precursors Statsbot, Metabase, Thoughtspot, Veezoo&#8230;, where strict syntax requests disguised API requests as natural language. However, the destination was all of the other BI tools and data apps out there. A single source of truth, governance, performance&#8230; not specifically AI, as AI was still a dream in this pre-GPT-3 era. As AI has captured a greater and greater mindshare, till the point where we are now where it&#8217;s nearly at 100%, any delays to making data agents can no longer be tolerated. It&#8217;s not a case of will they or won&#8217;t they have a semantic layer - any company that wants to...

Photo by Ian Taylor on Unsplash Recently, I&#8217;ve been hearing that information security teams, who already typically conduct a vendor evaluation before onboarding and granting access to company data, have started requesting a second review when a vendor also offers AI functionality. Every vendor will eventually have AI functionality by the end of this year! Having two security evaluations is very inefficient in a world where every vendor will need it. A year or two ago, you may have been able to say that only a minority of vendors have AI features&#8230; not today and not ever again. One interesting example was of a company where at least 20% 1 of the company used Grammarly. Now, Grammarly isn&#8217;t some unheard-of vendor; it's well-known by nearly all information workers and used by a vast number of them, too. The company recently asked all workers who had Grammarly installed to uninstall it, because they realised that Grammarly has AI features&#8230; If you consider what the company is trying to protect itself from, it is attempting to avoid liability for a data breach by Grammarly, where it lacks adequate liability protection because employees are using the free tier of Grammarly and are not on an enterprise plan. I understand why the information security team felt the need to tell employees to stop using Grammarly here. It&#8217;s not really going to secure data very much; the data has already bolted through years of use by employees. It is primarily a liability shift; the employees have been instructed not to use Grammarly, and therefore, the company has likely taken reasonable steps to avoid invalidating their insurance policy should a data breach occur. However, my main problem is the reactive nature of the information security team here. Of course, an information security team cannot preempt every possible vendor use by employees, especially when it is a tool choice made by engineering, who will know their tools better than the information security tea...

A few months ago, I bought a split ortholinear mechanical keyboard. I had noticed that my typing position using my Mac keyboard was not ideal, where I kind of twisted my wrist into position. I also ended up doing little twists during typing to hit specific keys. Long story short, my new keyboard keeps my arms and wrists in a good position, and my wrists can stay stationary during typing 1 &#128588;. I learned during this process that I have relatively short little fingers compared to my ring fingers, which actually dictates needing a different type of keyboard layout, where the columns of keys for my little fingers need to be much further down than my ring and middle fingers. Rule of thumb: if the ends of your little fingers don&#8217;t extend past the top knuckle of your ring fingers, then you are probably in the same boat as me 2 . These kinds of keyboards are customisable using a firmware called QMK, which has a CLI that you use to manage your keyboard layouts and flash it with new ones. The CLI, over time, has become reasonably complicated, and there is additional complexity from the sheer number of possible keyboards, modifications and chipsets you can have. I could have spent some time figuring out how to adjust my keymap files manually by Googling and asking the QMK community 3 , but the year isn&#8217;t 2021. I used Windsurf to change or create the files I needed to change my keymap; it did it in one shot with no issues. The repo comes with a bunch of default keymaps, which act as easy examples to learn from for Cascade. However, in order to actually flash your keyboard, you need to both install the CLI successfully, which has a lot of dependencies, and use the correct commands to compile and then flash your keyboard. I initially tried using the CLI manually, as I&#8217;m fairly proficient using shells and CLIs. However, I came across some issues. I probably could have figured them out, but after a few tries and making new Python environments, I gave up and ...

Earlier this week, I participated as the moderator for one of the boardroom discussions at Gartner&#8217;s CDAO C-level Communities event. It was quite a different experience from speaking at a conference, which I have done a few times before. You can&#8217;t really plan how the discussion will unfold. You can have a set of questions to guide the conversation, but ideally, you would prefer the discussion to flow organically without too much intervention from you and your discussion leaders, who are there to help steer the discussion if necessary. There were long periods during the discussion when various attendees were bouncing ideas off one another and allowing others to participate&#8230; I didn&#8217;t want to intervene; they were doing great on their own! What was truly challenging was not proposing the solution directly. The topic revolved around scaling AI usage in organisations, clearly linked to data, considering the conference audience. As you know from many of my previous posts, I believe that text-to-semantic layer is superior to text-to-SQL. Scratch that, I know it is . I often found myself having to bite my tongue when attendees detailed some of their approaches to enabling natural language access to data. Instead, I had to guide them towards considering the potential drawbacks of lesser methods. The conference audience was distinctly different from any others I had attended before. Snowflake Summit, Big Data London, dbt Coalesce, Databricks AI World Tour&#8230; whenever I have been to these, I have always recognised familiar faces. Not here - these folks aren&#8217;t early adopters, they are in the long tail of the late majority. Microsoft&#8217;s dominance in large regulated enterprises was very evident. If members of this audience were even permitted to use AI at work, it would be Microsoft Copilot without exception. It truly struck me how much of a disadvantage this can be. Some people spoke of how poor Microsoft Copilot is at transcription during T...

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about the acquisition of Windsurf by OpenAI and how it could be really significant for the speed of automation in coding. I predicted that Windsurf, powered by custom-trained OpenAI models, focused on the workflows in Windsurf, would have a significant advantage over Cursor, which won&#8217;t have such backing from a frontier model producer. I also talked about how I was excited to see the general release of nao as a similar IDE in concept to Windsurf, but instead focused on the needs of data folks. I described Windsurf, Cursor and nao all as VSCode forks, which is true, but highlighted one point that I hadn&#8217;t put enough emphasis on - Windsurf and Cursor actually build their own models to fit their workflows and this is the real value of their companies. This is partly why they are so attractive to the big AI companies as an acquisition target; they are not only fellow model builders, but also have a niche dataset geared towards coding that is now uniquely produced by the users of these IDEs. nao Labs will also have to follow this path to build a company of comparable value to Windsurf of Cursor. It looks like they&#8217;ve taken the very first step . Related to this topic was a really interesting post by , on the decline of Stack Overflow: Number of questions asked per month on StackOverflow. Data source: this Gist Back in the day, when I wanted to figure out how to do something in SQL, Python, Go etc and didn&#8217;t know how, I would Google what I wanted and it most likely would find a few StackOverflow posts similar to my question. I would always then, to a greater or lesser extent, have to adapt the code in the StackOverflow posts to my situation. It was a great way of learning new methods, as you had to learn the methods shown in order to use them effectively - you rarely could just copy/paste. However, it wasn&#8217;t particularly fast. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I looked anything up in the way I described above....
