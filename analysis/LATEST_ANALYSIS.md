## Content Playbook

### Template 1: The Hot Take
**Hook:** "Unpopular opinion: [controversial data engineering stance]"
**Audio:** Voiceover with trending sound
**Visual:** Face-to-camera, authentic setting
**Difficulty:** Easy - just needs confidence
**Why it works:** Controversy drives comments. Data engineers have strong opinions. Taking a stance polarizes but builds loyal following.

### Template 2: The Tutorial Teaser
**Hook:** "How to [specific task] in 60 seconds"
**Audio:** Clear voiceover, no music
**Visual:** Screen recording with annotations
**Difficulty:** Medium - requires editing
**Why it works:** Searchable, evergreen, solves real problems. Algorithm favors educational content with high completion rates.

### Template 3: The Career Pivot
**Hook:** "From [role] to Data Engineer - here's what I learned"
**Audio:** Conversational voiceover
**Visual:** Face-to-camera or B-roll montage
**Difficulty:** Easy - storytelling format
**Why it works:** Relatable to aspirational audience. Career content has broad appeal beyond just technical viewers.

### Template 4: The Tool Comparison
**Hook:** "Fabric vs [competitor] for [use case]"
**Audio:** Educational voiceover
**Visual:** Split screen or side-by-side demos
**Difficulty:** Medium - needs both tools
**Why it works:** People actively search for comparisons when making tool decisions. High intent audience.

### Template 5: The Behind the Scenes
**Hook:** "Building [project] in Fabric - Day [X]"
**Audio:** Casual narration
**Visual:** Work-in-progress screen captures
**Difficulty:** Easy - document as you go
**Why it works:** Series format builds anticipation and following. Shows real work, not polished tutorials.

## Gaps & Opportunities

### Untapped Content Areas

1. **Microsoft Fabric TikTok** - Only 19K avg views but 6.3% engagement shows hungry audience with no dominant creator serving them

2. **Fabric Short-Form Tutorials** - YouTube dominates this space, TikTok severely underserved. Cross-post opportunity is massive.

3. **Fabric Personality Creator** - No dominant TikTok creator in the Fabric space. First-mover advantage available for whoever claims it.

4. **Tool Comparison Content** - People search "Fabric vs Databricks" constantly but limited quality content exists. Searchable, evergreen.

5. **Career + Technical Hybrid** - Pure tutorials get views, career content gets engagement. Combine both: "How I used Fabric to get promoted"

6. **Data Engineering Hot Takes** - Opinion content drives 6-10% engagement. Data engineers love debating tools and practices.

7. **Behind-the-Scenes Series** - Build in public format underused. Document real projects, share failures, create narrative arcs.

8. **Cross-Platform Repurposing** - YouTube Shorts to TikTok adaptation is underutilized. Same content, different algorithm optimization.

---

## Red Flags

### Azure-Specific Content
- Underperforms compared to generic data engineering content by 5-10x
- Audience searches for solutions not platforms
- Lead with problem, mention Azure as solution not headline

### Basic SQL Tutorials
- Massively saturated market - every bootcamp covers SELECT/JOIN
- Differentiate with advanced patterns or domain-specific applications
- Focus on performance optimization not basics

### Substack Video Embeds
- Only 1.8% engagement despite decent views
- Platform mismatch - video consumers are not newsletter readers
- Use Substack for thought leadership not video distribution

### Long-Form Tutorials
- Lose to Shorts on every metric
- Attention spans have shifted dramatically
- Repurpose into Shorts series - one long tutorial equals 5-10 Shorts

### Recent Content Performance
- Last 30 days showing only 0.8% engagement
- May indicate algorithm changes or content quality issues
- Test different formats and posting times

## KEY INSIGHTS

1. **YouTube Shorts for reach, TikTok for community.** YouTube delivers 3x the views, TikTok delivers 45% higher engagement. Use both strategically.

2. **Generic beats specific.** "Data engineering" content outperforms "Microsoft Fabric" content by 5x on views. Lead with broad appeal, specify in content.

3. **@eczachly is the model.** Confident opinions, career advice, data engineering philosophy. 905K average views with 4.4% engagement. Study his format.

4. **Fabric TikTok is wide open.** No dominant creator. 6.3% engagement on existing content shows hungry audience. First-mover advantage available.

5. **Azure content needs a format refresh.** Low performance isn't about the topic - it's about the format. Try Shorts instead of long-form.

6. **Career content outperforms technical content.** "How I became a data engineer" beats "How to write a DAX formula" on engagement.

7. **Personality drives engagement.** Top engagement (10%+) comes from face-on-camera, opinion-driven content. Technical accuracy is secondary.

8. **Recent content can still win.** Last 7 days content shows 5.7% engagement - the space isn't saturated with good creators.

9. **Substack is for thought leadership, not video.** 1.8% engagement on video embeds. Use Substack for depth, not distribution.

10. **The tool comparison gap is real.** People search "Fabric vs Databricks" - limited quality content exists. Searchable, evergreen opportunity.
