## FORMAT TYPE (Biggest Differentiator)

| Format | Count | Views/Day | vs. Average |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Storytime** | 68 | **84,623** | +216% |
| POV | 77 | 45,580 | +70% |
| Day-in-life | 68 | 40,402 | +51% |
| Trend | 137 | 38,487 | +44% |

| Reaction | 11 | 24,955 | -7% |
| Performance | 16 | 23,889 | -11% |
| Behind scenes | 81 | 10,815 | -60% |
| Skit | 68 | 7,114 | -73% |
| Review | 39 | 6,037 | -77% |
| **Tutorial** | 82 | **3,199** | **-88%** |
| **Educational** | 10 | **273** | **-99%** |

**Critical Finding:** Storytime content is 26x more effective than tutorials. Stop making educational content.

---

## HOOK TECHNIQUE (Second Biggest Differentiator)

| Technique | Count | Views/Day | vs. Average |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Open loop** | 12 | **197,421** | +638% |
| Transformation | 16 | 76,539 | +186% |
| Pattern interrupt | 45 | 42,293 | +58% |
| Curiosity gap | 120 | 32,926 | +23% |
| Action | 7 | 19,706 | -26% |
| Statement | 55 | 14,205 | -47% |
| Confession | 67 | 12,964 | -52% |
| **Relatable pain** | 220 | **12,413** | **-54%** |
| **Bold claim** | 116 | **10,387** | **-61%** |

**Open loops are 15x better than relatable pain.** Stop using "relatable pain" hooks - they're overused (220 videos) and underperform.

---

## VIDEO DURATION

| Duration | Count | Views/Day | vs. Average |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **60-120s** | 93 | **53,385** | +100% |
| 0-15s | 442 | 27,940 | +4% |
| 15-30s | 150 | 24,883 | -7% |
| 120s+ | 80 | 13,037 | -51% |
| **30-60s** | 97 | **8,840** | **-67%** |

**Counterintuitive:** Longer videos (60-120s) perform 2x better than short clips. The 30-60s range is the worst - it's "too long to be quick, too short to be a story."

---

## LOOP FRIENDLY (Major Myth Busted)

| Loop Friendly | Count | Views/Day |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| **No** | 123 | **63,231** |
| Yes | 729 | 20,720 |

**Non-loop content performs 3x better.** The conventional wisdom to "make it loop" is completely wrong. Content with clear endings that don't loop outperforms loop-optimized content by 3x.

---

## PRIMARY EMOTION

| Emotion | Count | Views/Day |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Joy** | 454 | **36,111** |
| Amusement | 201 | 22,128 |
| Anticipation | 78 | 15,112 |
| Sadness | 13 | 12,517 |
| Surprise | 26 | 11,009 |
| **Inspiration** | 40 | **2,960** |
| **Trust** | 19 | **1,658** |

**Joy wins.** Stop trying to inspire or build trust - just make people happy.

---

## HUMOR TYPE

| Humor | Count | Views/Day |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Physical** | 13 | **69,714** |
| Situational | 151 | 26,647 |
| Observational | 190 | 23,834 |
| **Self-deprecating** | 17 | **10,663** |

**Physical humor is 6.5x better than self-deprecating.** Stop putting yourself down - show something funny happening instead.

---

## PRODUCTION QUALITY

| Quality | Count | Views/Day |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **High** | 43 | **42,900** |
| Medium | 773 | 27,044 |
| Low | 17 | 4,887 |
| **Professional** | 10 | **1,200** |

**Over-production kills performance.** Professional quality content performs 35x worse than high quality. There's a sweet spot - high quality but not over-produced.

---

## CAMERA TYPE

| Camera | Count | Views/Day |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Handheld** | 456 | **32,650** |
| Selfie | 237 | 18,915 |
| Tripod | 96 | 11,892 |
| POV | 29 | 10,504 |
| Screen record | 12 | 6,939 |

**Handheld beats tripod by 3x.** The stability of a tripod doesn't help - the energy of handheld wins.

---

## FACE VISIBILITY

| Face | Count | Views/Day |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Full + Partial** | 15 | **213,721** |
| Multiple people | 44 | 68,635 |
| Full face | 615 | 23,173 |
| No face | 68 | 19,442 |
| **Partial only** | 72 | **7,107** |

**Dynamic face visibility wins.** Mixing full face and partial shots (movement, camera changes) performs 9x better than static full face. Don't just sit there - move!

---

## NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

| Structure | Count | Views/Day |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Reveal** | 114 | **44,138** |
| Linear | 515 | 30,404 |
| Problem/solution | 61 | 11,857 |
| List | 53 | 11,407 |
| Before/after | 45 | 8,043 |
| Q&A | 42 | 5,640 |
| **Comparison** | 9 | **309** |

**Reveal structure is best.** Build to a reveal, don't compare or list.

---

## PACING

| Pacing | Count | Views/Day |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Varied** | 5 | **132,320** |
| Fast | 327 | 30,669 |
| Medium | 501 | 23,824 |
| Slow | 15 | 15,242 |

**Varied pacing is 5x better than constant fast.** Change your pace throughout the video.

---

## EDITING PACE

| Editing | Count | Views/Day |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Fast cuts | 541 | 28,687 |
| Medium | 297 | 24,203 |
| Slow | 5 | 18,400 |
| Single shot | 5 | 10,945 |

Fast cuts work slightly better, but it's not a huge differentiator.

---

## TOP PERFORMING COMBINATIONS

| Format | Technique | Setting | Count | Views/Day |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Storytime** | **Curiosity gap** | **Home** | 6 | **375,668** |
| Storytime | Relatable pain | Outdoor | 7 | 154,568 |
| Trend | (none) | Home | 11 | 144,963 |
| Performance | Visual | Club | 3 | 69,044 |
| Day-in-life | Bold claim | Business | 4 | 47,921 |

**The Winner: Storytime + Curiosity Gap + Home = 376K views/day**

This is 14x the average (27K) and only 6 videos use this combination.

---

## WHAT THE AI SCORES PREDICT

### Hook Strength Score
Almost all videos scored 8/10 - not enough variance to analyze.

### Viral Potential Score
| Score | Count | Views/Day |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 7 | 831 | 27,347 |
| 5-6 | 12 | 6,500 |

Score of 7 actually correlates with better performance. The AI scoring has some predictive value.

### Replicability Score
| Score | Count | Views/Day |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 7 | 820 | 27,636 |
| 8-9 | 26 | 6,160 |

**Higher replicability = worse performance.** Easy-to-copy content doesn't perform as well. Original ideas win.

---

## PREVIOUS ANALYSIS FINDINGS (Still Valid)
