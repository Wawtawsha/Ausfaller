## Setting Performance (BY ACTUAL VIEWS)

| Setting | Count | Avg Views | Avg Likes | Avg Comments |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Club** | 49 | **1,486,286** | 154,875 | 671 |
| Home | 131 | 1,240,711 | 100,680 | 770 |
| Outdoor | 68 | 1,058,168 | 75,924 | 539 |
| Kitchen | 10 | 870,719 | 66,185 | 644 |
| Bar | 101 | 768,701 | 82,737 | 342 |
| Studio | 21 | 649,640 | 63,236 | 377 |
| Restaurant | 30 | 596,132 | 50,019 | 375 |
| Car | 19 | 368,246 | 27,568 | 518 |
| Business | 66 | 366,746 | 22,544 | 146 |

**The Bar Paradox:** Bar content is 19% of the dataset but ranks #5 in average views (769K). Club content is 9% of the dataset but ranks #1 (1.49M avg views).

**Business Content Underperforms:** Despite being the "fastest growing" category (13% of content), business settings average only 367K views—the second-lowest of all settings. Growth ≠ performance.

**Home is the Sweet Spot:** 24% of content, 1.24M avg views, highest comment count (770). This is where volume meets performance.

## Visual Style Performance (BY ACTUAL VIEWS)

| Style | Count | Avg Views | Avg Likes | Avg Comments |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Polished** | 113 | **1,247,284** | 78,589 | 464 |
| Casual | 161 | 1,030,670 | 105,187 | 620 |
| Raw | 223 | 737,576 | 65,668 | 435 |
| Aesthetic | 30 | 242,067 | 12,992 | 157 |

**Polished is 69% better than Raw** (1.25M vs 737K avg views). The previous analysis noted "polished is rising"—now we have proof it performs.

**Casual has the highest likes per video** (105K avg). It's the middle ground that works: not too raw, not too produced.

**Aesthetic underperforms dramatically** (242K avg). Over-stylized content fails to connect.

## Audio Category Performance (BY ACTUAL VIEWS)

| Audio Type | Count | Avg Views | Avg Likes |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Original Audio** | 10 | **2,146,371** | 203,105 |
| Trending Audio | 157 | 1,036,233 | 84,625 |
| Music Only | 178 | 962,836 | 79,894 |
| Voiceover | 141 | 712,560 | 61,806 |
| Dialogue | 43 | 520,600 | 62,581 |

**Original Audio is 2x Trending Audio.** Despite only 10 videos in the sample, original audio averages 2.15M views vs. 1.04M for trending audio. Authenticity > algorithm chasing.

**Voiceover Underperforms:** Previous analyses suggested voiceover was "rebounding." The data shows voiceover content averages only 713K views—the second-lowest. Voice-forward may drive saves but not views.

**Trending Audio is Overused:** 29% of content uses trending audio, but it ranks #2 in performance. The value of trending sounds is overstated.

**The Winner: Visual + Bar + Casual = 2.8M avg views.** Only 5 videos use this combination. Massive opportunity.

## Revised Content Playbook (ENGAGEMENT-BACKED)

### Template 1: Visual Hook + Bar + Casual (THE WINNER)
- **Performance:** 2.8M avg views (highest in dataset)
- **Competition:** Only 5 videos
- **What it is:** Show something visually interesting happening in a bar setting with casual production
- **Example:** "Watch this bartender's pour" + satisfying action footage + casual editing

**Why it works:** Visual hooks grab attention. Bar setting provides context. Casual style feels authentic. This is the biggest opportunity gap in the data.

---

### Template 2: Question Hook + Home + Casual
- **Performance:** 2.25M avg views
- **Competition:** 11 videos
- **What it is:** Curiosity-driven question, filmed at home, relaxed production
- **Example:** "Why do bartenders do this?" + home demo + conversational style

**Why it works:** Questions create watch time. Home is accessible. Casual feels relatable.

---

### Template 3: Action Hook + Outdoor + Raw
- **Performance:** 1.32M avg views
- **Competition:** 5 videos
- **What it is:** Something happening outdoors, captured raw
- **Example:** Outdoor event bartending, festival pours, patio service

**Why it works:** Action hooks are the highest-engagement format. Outdoor is underexplored. Raw feels spontaneous.

---

### Template 4: Text Hook + Club + Raw
- **Performance:** 1.55M avg views
- **Competition:** 13 videos
- **What it is:** Text overlay capturing club energy, raw footage
- **Example:** Text joke over club footage, nightlife moments

**Why it works:** Text hooks normally underperform, but club energy compensates. The high-energy environment carries the content.

---

### Template 5: Statement + Business + Polished
- **Performance:** 1.19M avg views
- **Competition:** 12 videos
- **What it is:** Direct statement about bar operations, professional production
- **Example:** "Here's what running a bar actually costs" + clean visuals

**Why it works:** Business content only works when polished. The professional production signals credibility for professional topics.

## What the Data Disproves

### 1. "Voiceover is rebounding"
**Reality:** Voiceover content averages 713K views—second-lowest of all audio types. The previous analysis was wrong. Voiceover may drive saves, but it doesn't drive views.

### 2. "Business content is the new frontier"
**Reality:** Business settings average 367K views—the second-lowest of all settings. Business content is growing in volume but underperforming in engagement. Only the polished business content (1.19M avg) works.

### 3. "Statement hooks are dominant"
**Reality:** Statement hooks are 38% of content but average only 589K views. They're dominant by volume, not by performance. Visual hooks are 3x more effective.

### 4. "Trending audio is essential"
**Reality:** Original audio averages 2.15M views vs. trending audio at 1.04M. Trending audio is overused and underperforms.

### 5. "Aesthetic style is rising"
**Reality:** Aesthetic style averages 242K views—the lowest of all styles. Over-stylized content fails.
