## Content Playbook

### Template 1: The Tutorial Teaser
**Hook:** "How to [specific data engineering task] in 60 seconds"
**Audio:** Clear voiceover, no music distractions
**Visual:** Screen recording with annotations/highlights
**Difficulty:** Medium - requires editing and clarity
**Why it works:** Educational content with high replicability (7.42 avg) gets saved and shared. Searchable, evergreen.

### Template 2: The Career Pivot Story
**Hook:** "From [previous role] to Data Engineer - here's what I learned"
**Audio:** Conversational voiceover, authentic delivery
**Visual:** Face-to-camera or career journey visuals
**Difficulty:** Easy - storytelling format
**Why it works:** Question hooks at 33% show career content resonates. Relatable to aspirational audience.

### Template 3: The Tool Comparison
**Hook:** "Fabric vs Databricks - which should you learn?"
**Audio:** Educational voiceover, balanced perspective
**Visual:** Split screen or side-by-side comparisons
**Difficulty:** Medium - needs knowledge of both tools
**Why it works:** People actively search for tool comparisons when making career/tech decisions. High intent audience.

### Template 4: The Hot Take
**Hook:** "[Controversial data engineering opinion] - change my mind"
**Audio:** Confident voiceover, direct delivery
**Visual:** Face-to-camera, authentic setting
**Difficulty:** Easy - requires confidence and knowledge

## Gaps & Opportunities

### Untapped Content Areas

1. **Microsoft Fabric TikTok** - YouTube dominates Fabric content but TikTok is underserved. First-mover advantage available.

2. **Data Engineering Career Content** - Question hooks at 33% show demand. "How I got my first DE job" format underutilized.

3. **Tool Deep-Dives** - Comparison content is searched but limited quality exists. "Fabric vs X" format has room.

4. **Non-English Markets** - @wondertechoficial shows Spanish-language DE content works (600K avg). Other languages untapped.

5. **Cross-Platform Strategy** - YouTube Shorts to TikTok adaptation is underutilized. Same tutorial, different optimization.

6. **Behind-the-Scenes Series** - Build in public format rare in data engineering. Document real projects.

7. **Hot Takes on DE Tools** - Opinion content drives engagement. Data engineers love debating tools.

8. **Interview Prep Content** - High-intent audience searching for DE interview tips. Evergreen and searchable.

---

## Red Flags

### Platform Mismatch
- TikTok gets only 14M views vs YouTube's 50M for DE content
- Educational audiences prefer YouTube's search and save features
- Consider YouTube-first strategy for tutorials

### Statement Saturation
- 55% already use statement hooks in DE content
- Differentiate with unique perspectives or delivery
- Try question hooks for variety (33% share shows they work)

### Replicability Double-Edge
- High replicability (7.42/10) means content gets copied fast
- Add unique expertise, personality, or production value
- Build personal brand to differentiate

### Substack Limitations
- Only 42K avg views vs YouTube's 109K
- Use Substack for depth, not reach
- Drive newsletter signups from video content
