**Generated:** January 15, 2026
**Analysis Scope:** 7,113 posts | 2,304 analyzed | 3 platforms
**Niche:** Data Engineering (NOT bartending/nightlife)

---

## Executive Summary

- **DEMOS GET 37% MORE VIEWS than tutorials** (323K vs 235K) despite lower educational value - entertainment matters even in B2B
- **TikTok wins engagement (4.6%)** but YouTube Shorts wins educational quality (7.3 clarity vs 5.9)
- **"Mixed" teaching technique dominates reach** with 721K avg views - 7x better than talking head alone
- **Microsoft stack owns the conversation:** Power BI (314 mentions), Databricks (140), ADF (132), Fabric (122)
- **Intermediate content is underserved:** Only 15% of content but has 40% higher educational scores
- **Curiosity hooks are unicorns:** Only 30 videos but averaging 4.3M views each

## Platform Performance Breakdown

| Platform | Posts | Analyzed | Avg Views | Engagement | Clarity | Edu Value |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| TikTok | 5,462 | 1,431 | 240,430 | 4.6% | 5.9 | 5.1 |
| YouTube Shorts | 1,415 | 836 | 233,045 | 2.5% | 7.3 | 6.5 |
| Substack | 236 | 37 | 30,690 | 2.1% | 6.9 | 6.8 |

### Key Insight
YouTube Shorts delivers **24% higher educational value** than TikTok, but TikTok's engagement rate is **84% higher**. For building authority, prioritize YouTube. For community building, prioritize TikTok.

## Content Type Analysis

| Content Type | Count | Avg Edu Value | Avg Views | Recommendation |
|--------------|-------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Demo | 234 | 4.3 | 322,775 | HIGH PRIORITY - Views trump depth |
| Tutorial | 643 | 6.7 | 235,495 | Core content - balance reach + value |
| Career Advice | 672 | 5.8 | 107,877 | High volume, moderate performance |
| Explanation | 253 | 6.6 | 30,172 | Low reach - needs better hooks |
| Comparison | 52 | 6.5 | 94,570 | Underutilized - good performance |

### The Demo Paradox
Demos have the **lowest educational value (4.3)** but the **highest views (323K)**. This suggests audiences want to see tools in action, not deep explanations. **Action: Lead with demos, follow with tutorials.**

## Teaching Technique Effectiveness

| Technique | Count | Avg Views | Avg Edu Value |
|-----------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Mixed (multiple techniques) | 74 | 720,811 | 2.6 |
| Animation | 59 | 326,060 | 3.7 |
| Screen Share | 395 | 273,972 | 5.8 |
| Talking Head + Slides | 32 | 226,314 | 7.0 |
| Screen Share + Live Coding | 42 | 37,291 | 8.3 |

### Critical Finding
**Mixed technique content gets 7x more views** than pure talking head. However, screen share + live coding delivers the **highest educational value (8.3)**.

**Optimal Strategy:** Open with mixed/animated hook (first 3 seconds), transition to screen share + live coding for the meat.

## Hook Type Performance

| Hook Type | Count | Avg Strength | Avg Views |
|-----------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Curiosity | 30 | 2.9 | 4,264,975 |
| Comparison | 4 | 7.8 | 360,152 |
| Statement | 1,252 | 6.3 | 155,960 |
| Question | 768 | 7.3 | 109,172 |
| Problem | 95 | 7.5 | 78,414 |

### The Curiosity Gap
Curiosity hooks have **LOW strength scores (2.9)** but **MASSIVE views (4.3M)**. This is the most underutilized hook type in data engineering content. Most creators default to statements (57%) when curiosity drives 27x more views.

**Example curiosity hooks:**
- "I discovered something weird in the Fabric API..."
- "This one setting cost my client $40K..."
- "Wait until you see what happens when you do this in Power BI..."

## Tool Ecosystem Coverage

| Tool | Mentions | Avg Views | Market Signal |
|------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Power BI | 314 | 48,399 | Saturated - high competition |
| Databricks | 140 | 12,345 | Growing - moderate competition |
| Azure Data Factory | 132 | 6,190 | Enterprise focus - low viral potential |
| Microsoft Fabric | 122 | 9,847 | Emerging - opportunity window |
| SQL Server | 73 | 45,917 | Evergreen - consistent performance |
| Synapse | 45 | 1,239 | Declining interest |
| Tableau | 24 | 141,294 | Underserved - high view potential |
| Snowflake | 13 | 16,935 | Major gap - high market interest |

### Opportunity Gaps
1. **Snowflake** - Only 13 mentions but massive market demand
2. **Tableau** - Only 24 mentions but 141K avg views (3x Power BI)
3. **dbt** - Minimal coverage despite industry adoption
4. **Airflow** - Missing from top mentions entirely

## Skill Level Distribution

| Level | Count | % of Content | Avg Views | Avg Edu Value |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| Beginner | 1,833 | 84% | 236,876 | 5.3 |
| Intermediate | 323 | 15% | 36,561 | 7.5 |
| Advanced | <20 | <1% | varies | varies |

### The Intermediate Gap
**84% of content targets beginners**, but intermediate content has **42% higher educational value**. There's a massive underserved audience of practitioners who've moved past basics but aren't yet experts.

**Intermediate content opportunities:**
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Architecture decision trade-offs
- Production debugging and monitoring
- Cost optimization strategies
- Team workflow patterns
