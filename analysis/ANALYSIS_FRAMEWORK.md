# Trend Intelligence Analysis Framework

## Data Source
Fetch from: `https://ausfaller.up.railway.app/analytics/all`

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- What hook types dominate? Why might that be?
- What's the relationship between audio choice and viral potential?
- Are there visual style patterns that correlate with replicability?

### 2. Strategic Insights
For each major finding, provide:
- **What**: The pattern observed
- **Why it works**: Psychology/marketing reasoning
- **How to use it**: Concrete action steps

### 3. Content Playbook
Based on the data, create 3-5 specific content templates:
- Hook formula (first 3 seconds)
- Audio recommendation
- Visual style
- Expected difficulty
- Why this combination works

### 4. Gaps & Opportunities
- What's underrepresented in the data that might be worth testing?
- Any contrarian angles the data suggests?
- What would differentiate from the crowd?

### 5. Red Flags
- Patterns that seem overused/saturated
- Approaches that score low on replicability
- Trends that may be declining
